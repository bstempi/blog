Unfortunately, I'm putting my bass and amp up for sale.  Instead of
trying to Ebay them, I decided to do
a \ `consignment <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consignment>`__ deal with
`Springfield Music <http://www.springfieldmusicstore.com/>`__.  I'm
selling a 5 string Peavey Foundation bass and a 100w Carvin ProBass 100
amp.  They're currently listed for $219.95 and $189.95, respectively.

If you know anyone that's interested, feel free to send them to this
post.  Any help unloading them would be greatly appreciated :).

UPDATE:  These guys sold, so I removed the images.  Thanks!
