Shortly before Christmas, I got this message from
`Erik <https://www.facebook.com/feneur>`__, the producer of `0
A.D. <http://wildfiregames.com/0ad>`__:

    I hope things are well with you. Have you still gotten a moment or
    two for 0 A.D. or have you become too busy? We've been trying to
    contact you via PM/email, but haven't got any response, so it's hard
    to know the case of things.

    If you do have a moment or two we have things we could use your help
    with. Both some forum upgrades etc, but more importantly/hopefully
    more interesting as well we are finally getting closer to a new web
    site. We do have a designer working on the design, and a web
    development applicant who might be able to help out with the
    technical stuff. But naturally it would feel a lot better if you
    would be in charge of the technical side as we know and trust you.

    Either way I hope you will have a good Christmas and regardless of
    whether or not your current situation allows you to help out I'll be
    grateful for a reply so we know how things are :)

D'awwwwwww.

Since then, I've gotten pretty serious about getting a new site
delivered.  We've been making a more conscious effort to stay organized,
work hard, and get something tangible accomplished.  If you follow the
project's progress at all, you'll see that we've recently closed
a\ `bunch of website
tickets <http://trac.wildfiregames.com/query?group=status&component=Website+%2F+Forum&order=priority>`__,
mostly revolving around the new site.  Barring any major setbacks, we'll
keep pushing forward!

Shameless plug:  If you have ever had an interest in joining a F/OSS
group, are looking for something to put on the resume, or just have too
much time on your hands, hit me up!  We could always use more help.
