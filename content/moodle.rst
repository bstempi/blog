I recently wrote about the HSCC class that I teach and posted a link to
the course's website.  While thinking the other day, it occurred to me
that I have yet to write about my experience using Moodle, which powers
that website.  Since its such an awesome piece of OSS, I figured that it
was worth some space in my blog.  Here we go!

Bottom line up front:  I like Moodle.  I think it can stand to improve,
but I think it's pretty far ahead of Blackboard.

What's to Like?
================
Where do I start?  I spend most of my time teaching courses, so I
guess I'll start talking about what an instructor sees.  The first
really cool thing is the topic outline -- you can choose how many
topics/weeks are in your course and prepopulate them.  You can hide
and reveal them as you see fit, which makes it easy to recycle
material from course to course.

The lessons are pretty cool little bits -- within a lesson, you can make
a sort of blog post.  You can then attach several objects to that blog
post, such as a quiz, assignment, document, poll, and so on.  The tools
to add these items to your lesson are pretty easy and intuitive.  You
can even add wikis and forums

The "forums" (Moodle-speak for message boards) are pretty neat, too.
 The front page by default is a message board.  So, what makes it more
like a message board than a blog post?  For one, you can have the post
emailed out to everyone that's subscribed to that forum.  By default,
all registered users are enrolled to the front page and each student is
enrolled to the News Forum within each course that they're taking.
 There's even an "oops" feature.  By default, the forum will wait for 30
minutes before mailing out your post, which gives you a chance to fix
anything that you might have slipped by you until after clicking the
"submit" button.  The recipients of this email get a neatly formatted
HTML message that gives them a copy of the post.  The user can then
reply directly to the poster via email or on the forum.  Unlike (some)
blog posts, these forums support threading -- they can easily carry
multiple questions or discussions per post.

The quiz feature quickly became one of my favorite.  Each course has a
pool of questions.  These questions could be multiple choice (with
multiple answers or partial credit), true/false, free-response,
matching, calculated (like a math or physics problem), and a few other
types.  For the numeric, calculated, multiple choice, and true/false,
the quizzes auto-grade themselves.  They can even leave specific
feedback for students based on their answer.  You can give them multiple
attempts, each one resulting in a different amount of partial credit.
 When giving the quiz, Moodle can even time the student and mix up the
questions for you, helping to cut down on cheating.  The free response
question types are pretty cool, too.  An instructor gets to leave some
piece of feedback (which is displayed on the student's grade report)
along with the grade.  You can delegate grading to another instructor
(such as a TA).

Assignments are the last of my favorite features.  Some of my
assignments require students to write free responses or to create HTML
or Java files.  The assignments activity (these objects are all called
activities in Moodle-speak) allows me to easily receive text or files
from a student.  I can do things like set hard or soft limits on the due
dates.  Once I've received the assignment, I can grade it, leave
feedback, select a grade, and have Moodle notify the student.  Slick!

What's to Hate?
================
Most of what I hate lives on the administrative back end.  The
biggest of these is the plugin system.  CMSs like WordPress and Drupal
allow you to upload packages that it can unzip and install. You can't
do that with Moodle yet -- you have to unzip your own packages and
carefully place each component in the appropriate folder.  What a
pain!  You need SSH or FTP access to the server to add any
functionality.  I hope this changes soon -- this really puts me off.
 There are so many good plugins that I'm hesitant to install, such as
Facebook integration, tag cloud generators, and many others.  I'd
rather wait for an improvement in the plugin system rather than
attempt an iffy operation.

The default roles that exist work well, but I would like to see some
others.  I and many others teach high school kids.  It'd be nice if
there were an easy way to link parents and students so that the parent
gets all (or some) of the same notifications that the students gets.
 Its a bit of a pain to set things up so that parents can see their
student's grade.  I understand that plugins exist to do this type of
thing -- see my first complaint.

Themes -- there's a bit of a sore point.  Moodle comes with a few
default themes.  Most of them are pretty horrendous.  There are a few
that look nice, but they're not very customizable.  Drupal and WordPress
(especially with the 3.0 release) allows themes that offer options to
the user, such as certain colors or the ability to set a header image.
 No one wants to go hack some code or have to use (S)FTP to upload a new
header image -- yuck!  I'd rather just leave my site with the default
looks than to go through that.

Conclusion
===========
Despite Moodle's weaknesses, I still think that Moodle is a great
piece of software.  Its fairly (some menus get confusing) easy for an
instructor to use and still manages to maintain its power.  Its served
me well this year, and I'm sure it'll continue to serve me well.  I
like it more than Blackboard and was happy that it came with most of
the functionality that I wanted.  The last thing I wanted to do was
try to use WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla with plugins to provide the
additional functionality -- I want it all in one place and
out-of-the-box.  Moodle did that for me.  Great job, Moodle devs!
