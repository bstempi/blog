Back in the winter, `Tim Henry <http://timjhenry.com>`__ got me hooked
on Minecraft. Due to having a life, I probably only played the game for
around 20 hours and then put it down for several months. Now that I'm
not teaching, Tim and I decided to pick it back up again. Instead of
using his netbook as a server, we figured that my mapping server would
be a good host.

By using `this
guide <http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Setting_up_a_server>`__
and this `Linux start-up
script <http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Server_startup_script>`__, I
managed to very quickly get a Minecraft server running on my mapping
server, which runs Ubtuntu 10.04 LTS. I don't expect many people to hop
on, but in case you're interested, the server is running on
bstempi.servebeer.com
