I'll make this one short:

On my `Readings <http://www.brianstempin.com/readings/>`__ page, I use a
WordPress `plugin <http://wordpress.org/plugins/openbook-book-data/>`__
that allows me to show off the books that I've read.  At the moment, I'm
pulling my data from `OpenLibrary.org <http://openlibrary.org/>`__ (an
`Internet Archive <http://archive.org/>`__ project).  The last book that
I read had no cover listed, and one of the other covers was smaller than
the rest.  Because it's a community data source, I was able to register
for an account and upload cover images.  Instant fix!  Not only is it
fixed for me, but it's fixed for anyone else who uses data about those
books from OpenLibrary.  I think it's really cool that I'm able to go
"fix the data."  That's something I could have never done if I was
pulling the metadata and cover images from Amazon or another closed
source.

I feel empowered.
