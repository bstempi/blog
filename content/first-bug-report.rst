Last night, I spent some time checking over a graph that I created (This
particular graph was the graph of connected traffic sensor stations
throughout the Minneapolis road network).  While looking through my
results in `QGIS <http://www.qgis.org/>`__, I came across some strange
behavior.  It turns out that I found a possible bug.

I've used OSS software for quite a few years, but I've never really
gotten involved with any of the bug reporting, testing, or development. 
Since so much of my research work relies on
`OpenGeo <http://opengeo.org/>`__ tools, I decided that I'd start
reporting bugs that I find in those packages.  It took me a bit to get
logged on and to find the correct place to file my bug report, but I did
it in < 30 minutes.

You can view my bug report
`here <https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2488>`__.  Go me!
