Sorry for the late post, but Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday of this week is the Philadelphia Regional FIRST Robotics
Competition!  Unfortunately, I will not be working at the event this
year, but I'll be going anyway.  This year's goal is to try to get as
many people as possible to come out and watch the competition Friday and
Saturday.  It's being hosted by Drexel University and is open to the
public.  Check out `the
schedule <http://www.philadelphiafirst.org/regional/regional-schedule>`__
to see when the matches are happening.  Hope to see you there!
