A few weeks ago I submitted a proposal to speak at
`CPOSC <http://www.cposc.org/>`__.  I recently received an email
notifying me that my proposal was selected!  I'll be speaking at
`Harrisburg University <http://www.harrisburgu.net/>`__ on Saturday,
October 16th.  I'll be talking about open source Geographic Information
Systems
(`GIS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system>`__)
and my traffic research project.  If you're a member of
`PLUG <http://phillylinux.org>`__, then you've already seen a majority
of what I plan on presenting.  I'll be touching on
`PostGIS <http://postgis.refractions.net/>`__,
`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org/>`__,
`OpenLayers <http://openlayers.org/>`__,
`OpenStreetMap <http://www.openstreetmap.org/>`__, and some other stuff.

CPOSC is supposed to be a low-cost one day conference.  I'd like to find
some people to carpool to Harrisburg with, so contact me if you're
interested!
