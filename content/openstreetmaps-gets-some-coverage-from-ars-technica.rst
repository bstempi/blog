So, I was perusing \ `ArsTechnica <http://arstechnica.com>`__ earlier
today and came across this article:
 http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2010/06/crowd-sourced-world-map.ars

In short:  they recapped the origins of OSM, discussed their goals, and
then went on to discuss some of the projects that have stemmed from
OSM's data.  Pretty cool stuff!  Its always nice to see a good project
get some good recognition.
