That's right!  After being a consumer in the OSS community for around 10
years, I'm finally committing something more than helping posts on a
forum -- I'm a webmaster!

The Desire
===========
When I was growing up, I was hooked on `RTS
games <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy>`__.  I used to
love playing `Age of
Empires <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_empires>`__ and the
original
`Warcraft <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans>`__.
 I then moved on to things like `AoE
II <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_empires_II>`__, `Warcraft
II <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_II>`__, `Total
Annihilation <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation>`__, and
so on.  I just loved RTSes!  I stopped playing them once I got to
college -- I just didn't have time to keep playing.

A few months ago, I started looking around for a new game to play.  I
had a little more free time than I normally do, so I decided to give
some of it to a game.  I decided that I wanted to find a Linux game
since I spent most of my time in `Ubuntu <http://ubuntu.com>`__.  After
looking around, I found a game that showed potential:  `0
A.D. <http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/>`__ At that time, it hadn't been
released yet.  I decided to simply drop my gaming urge and to move on.

Revisiting
==========
A few days ago, I decided to revisit the 0 A.D. website.  They still
haven't released anything yet, but the website stated that they were
close to releasing an alpha.  For whatever reason, I decided to comb
through their forums -- I wanted to know more.  While lurking through
some of their topics, I came across the `"Applications"
thread <http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?showforum=306>`__.
 Wildfire Games (the group producing 0 A.D.) had several openings.
The webmaster one caught my eye, so I decided to
`apply <http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=13179>`__.

Filling the Gap
================
Within a few hours of applying, I head from Aviv Sharon.  He quickly
thanked me for my application and invited me to the team's IRC
channel.  After speaking with Aviv for a bit, I was welcomed to the
team.  I now have access to the group's private resources, credentials
for the website, and a hefty task list.  I haven't had a chance to
actually bite anything off yet, but I hope to this week.  I'm pretty
excited about working on an open source game!
