Holy crap, where have I been?

All over the place, that's where. I've had a lot happen since I've last
posted:

-  I now hold a `skydiving
   license <http://www.uspa.org/USPAMembers/LicensesampRatings/Licenses/tabid/87/Default.aspx>`__
-  I have a new job at a place called
   `Coldlight <http://www.coldlight.com/>`__
-  I have a new girlfriend
-  The 0 A.D. website that I've contributed to off-and-on for the last
   couple of years `has been released <http://play0ad.com/>`__
-  I've learned how to write map/reduce jobs for
   `Hadoop <http://hadoop.apache.org/>`__
-  I've become a
   `Jenkins <http://jenkins-ci.org/>`__/`Nexus <http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/>`__/`Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__
   guru at work
-   I've been playing
   `D&D <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons>`__ regularly
-  and a bunch of other stuff!

I have a lot of writing to catch up on.  I'll be taking some time over
the next few weeks to make sure that my LinkedIn, Google+, and all of
that other stuff is up-to-date.  I also plan on writing posts on some of
the cool stuff I've learned and some of the cool devices I now own (like
my `Samsung Galaxy Tab
2 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_2_(10.1)>`__).

Write on!
