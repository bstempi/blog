I've mentioned before that I teach a class of high schoolers how to
program in Java.  In order to make things manageable and to make the
most of my time with the kids, I use `Moodle <http://moodle.org>`__\ to
organize, store, distribute all of my course content.  I've fallen in
love with it!  It can auto-grade my quizzes, serve as a file repository,
allow the students to keep notes, and track student progress.

Praises
=======

As this year's `BDPA HSCC program <http://hscc.bdpaphilly.org>`__ has
started taking off, I started looking at Moodle 2.0 and found some
things that were quite attractive to me:

-  New default theme.  I like the new theme more than the old one.  The
   menus are much easier to navigate and it has a nicer overall
   appearance.
-  New wiki plugin.  I started using a course to allow all of the
   coordinators to communicate.  Within this course, I started a forum,
   a wiki, and a few file folders.  Moodle 2.0's wiki is much nicer than
   1.9's and allows for the use of Creole for creating and styling
   content, which makes it easier for me to collaborate with my fellow
   volunteers.
-  New editor.  Moodle 1.9 used a text editor that didn't render in
   Chrome without a manual patch.  Version 2.0 features the use of
   `TinyMCE <http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/>`__.  I've not only used
   TinyMCE on other sites before, but I've also sites that utilize it.
    It's a nice piece that's been well integrated into Moodle.  The team
   did a really nice job with making sure that TinyMCE can correctly
   upload and display images.
-  plus a bunch more!

Criticisms
==========

I've criticized the Moodle upgrade/update system, and I'll criticize it
again:  WordPress has a model to copy.  Moodle has taken some steps
forward by allowing for upgrades from the CLI, but it's still not
polished enough to allow me to try and throw away plugins.  It's too
much of a process to experiment with new functionality.

Bottom Line
===========

So far, the new version has been running really, really well.  The
upgrade was flawless and the site is performing just as well as it did
with 1.9.  Another successful upgrade!
