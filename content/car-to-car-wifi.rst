Sorry that I haven't written in a bit -- I've been out-and-about instead
of living in front of my computer for a chance.

So, here's a pretty cool thing that I recently saw (did?).  Last week, I
traveled down to `Myrtle Beach <http://www.cityofmyrtlebeach.com/>`__,
South Carolina with a few friends to celebrate their graduation.  We
decided that traveling with 5 people in one car was just too much to
tolerate for a 10 hour drive, so we split into two cars.  Now:  what to
do for 10 hours?  Answer:  surf the 'net!

Rob Masterson was driving the lead car, which was co-piloted by
Christian Willman.  Here's the equipment being used in the lead car:

-  Rob's `power
   inverter <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(electrical)>`__
-  Chris's Macbook
-  Chris's `G1 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream>`__
-  Chris's `WAP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point>`__

Long story short: Chris's G1 has an application called
`PdaNet <http://www.junefabrics.com/index.php>`__ installed.  This
software allows him to connect his G1 to his Macbook (via USB) and to
allow the phone to act as a router and DHCP server.  Chris then went on
to connect his WAP to his Macbook (via ethernet) and to bridge the
connection.  Now, anyone within range of the WAP could connect and get
internet through his phone...kind of like a MiFi on steroids.  In the
chase car, piloted by `Tim Henry <http://timjhenry.com>`__, we were able
to get a decent wireless signal while on the highway.  For the majority
of the trip (until we got within an hour or two of Myrtle Beach), we
were able to surf the internet from both vehicles.

Even when the internet wasn't reachable, we were still able to keep
ourselves pretty occupied.  Tim brought a couple of movies on his
`netbook <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook>`__, so we sat it on the
dashboard and routed the audio though his car stereo.

I guess we can find a way to make anything geeky :-P.
