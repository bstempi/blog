I almost forgot to brag: 0 A.D. was Sourceforge's Project of the Month
in June. Check out the post here:

It feels pretty good to be on a team that's being recognized by the rest
of the open source community.  Also, this podcast was the first time
that I've ever heard Erik or Aviv speak.  Now I have a voice to read
their posts in!
