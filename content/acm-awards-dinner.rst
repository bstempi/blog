22APR2010 was the
`CIS <http://www.temple.edu/cis>`__/`ACM <http://acm.temple.edu>`__
Annual Awards Dinner. This is the one time during the year that the CIS
department invites out all of the students, faculty, staff, and alum for
a formal dinner and awards ceremony.  As always, `Sandy
Sorkin <http://ww2.cis.temple.edu/sorkin/>`__ took a million and one
`photos of the

In short:  several ACM'ers won awards.  Congrats to everyone that won an
