[[Work in Progress]]

I figured that it would be nice to list a bunch of my former projects as
a sort of portfolio.  The mix contains both professional and personal
projects.  I'm listing them chronologically, starting with the most
recent:

-  Temple University GenEd Department Website
-  `Traffic Research
   Project <{filename}projects/traffic-research-project   .rst/>`__ (GIS, PHP,
   PostgreSQL)
-  Philly BDPA's HSCC Website (Moodle, PHP)
-  `Temple ACM's Folding@Home
   Project <{filename}projects/temple-acm-folding-at-home-project.rst>`__ (Linux, Drupal,
   F@H)
-  `Temple ACM LAN Parties <{filename}projects/temple-acm-lan-parties.rst>`__
   (Linux, Drupal, Samba, Networks)
-  `SyllabiCMS <{filename}projects/syllabicms.rst>`__ (PHP, AJAX, MySQL)
