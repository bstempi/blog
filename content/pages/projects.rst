[[Work in Progress]]

I figured that it would be nice to list a bunch of my former projects as
a sort of portfolio.  The mix contains both professional and personal
projects.  I'm listing them chronologically, starting with the most
recent:

-  `0 A.D. Webmaster </projects/0-a-d-webmaster/>`__
-  Temple University GenEd Department Website
-  `Traffic Research
   Project </projects/traffic-research-project/>`__ (GIS, PHP,
   PostgreSQL)
-  Philly BDPA's HSCC Website (Moodle, PHP)
-  `Temple ACM's Folding@Home
   Project </projects/temple-acm’s-foldinghome-project/>`__ (Linux, Drupal,
   F@H)
-  `Temple ACM LAN Parties </projects/temple-acm-lan-parties/>`__
   (Linux, Drupal, Samba, Networks)
-  `SyllabiCMS </projects/syllabicms/>`__ (PHP, AJAX, MySQL)
