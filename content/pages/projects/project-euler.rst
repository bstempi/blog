I've had an account on `Project
Euler <http://www.projecteuler.net>`__ for a while, but I never really
used it.  A few years ago, I decided to start solving problems in PHP and Java. 
The hands-down coolest thing I learned so far was the
`sieve of
Eratosthenes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes>`__.

Anyways, I decided that it'd be cool if I posted my answers.  The
intention is to show others my implementation of each problem, namely
because the forums on PE are closed for all of the problems I've solved
thus far.  I would prefer that you refrain from looking at my
implementations until you've solved the puzzles yourself.  Of course, I
have no way of stopping you short of not posting them at all.  Most of my
previous answers are missing in action, but I recently decided to start solving
problems using Python.

Here is the link to
