|Wildfire Games|

In early July of 2010, I joined the `0
A.D. <http://www.wildfiregames.com/0ad>`__ team at `Wildfire
Games <http://www.wildfiregames.com/>`__.  They were looking for someone
to help run their website and to help roll out their new site by the
time they release their first alpha.  I was surprised when I heard back
from them on the same day that I applied.  They quickly welcomed me and
brought me on board.  Within a few days, I was given everything that I
needed in order to admin their website.  I was pretty amazed at how fast
they were able to get me oriented and working -- it really made me feel
like part of the team!

Most of my initial tasks had to do with rolling out their new website,
which runs on `WordPress <http://wordpress.org>`__ (still in
development).  I also work on some of the back-end web systems.
