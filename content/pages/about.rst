Well, you know my name now...that's a good start.

I live in Orlando and I'm a \ `Temple University <http://www.temple.edu>`__ alumnus with an Information Science and
Technology BS.Â  Here are some of the interesting academic things that
I've done:

-  I've spoken several time (`1 <https://github.com/bstempi/sjpwdg-spark-presentation>`__, `2 <https://github.com/bstempi/sjpwdg-docker-presentation>`__, `3 <https://github.com/bstempi/sjpwdg-pandas-presentation>`__) at the `South Jersey Python and Web Dev Group <https://www.meetup.com/South-Jersey-Python-User-Group/>`__

   development <http://hsccphilly.systemstechservices.com>`__ class for
