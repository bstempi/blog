|project euler logo|\ So, I've had an account on `Project
Euler <http://www.projecteuler.net>`__ for a while, but I never really
used it.  I solved one problem in PHP over a year ago and just never
went back.  Well, since I'm on spring break, I decided to solve a few
puzzles.  I solved problems 3, 5, 7, and 10 in Java.  Most of the
problems I just listed deal with prime numbers.  I've had a bit of a
fascination with primes for a year-ish, so I figured that I'd start with
those problems.  The hands-down coolest thing I learned so far was the
`sieve of
Eratosthenes <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes>`__.

Anyways, I decided that it'd be cool if I posted my answers.  The
intention is to show others my implementation of each problem, namely
because the forums on PE are closed for all of the problems I've solved
thus far.  I would prefer that you refrain from looking at my
implementations until you've solved the puzzles yourself.  Of course, I
have no way of stopping you short of not posting them at all.  As time
goes on, I'll add more documentation, review my previous answers for
possible inefficiencies, and add new answers.  I would have just posted
my code to an SVN repo, but Bluehost (my current host) doesn't provide
SVN via HTTP.
