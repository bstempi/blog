I've just recently updated `my
LinkedIn <http://www.linkedin.com/in/brianstempin>`__ to reflect it, but
I left `Vanguard <http://www.vanguard.com>`__ back in September to join
`Coldlight Solutions <http://www.coldlight.com>`__, a start-up in Wayne,
PA.

I've not written it here, but those who know me off-line know that I
would like to pursue a PhD at some point in my life.  I felt that moving
to Coldlight would put me closer to that goal.  Nothing against
Vanguard, but I felt that I wasn't growing that much there.  Writing web
services are good and fun, but I was using versions of libraries that
were written for Java 1.4.  I wasn't using anything terribly interesting
outside of `Spring <http://www.springsource.org/spring-framework>`__.
 Unfortunately, Spring isn't the answer to everything.  There are bigger
and much more interesting things than Spring in the Java world.

Coldlight does a lot of work with large data sets and machine learning,
which happens to be a fairly hot research topic.  I figured the move
would give me a chance to explore a lot of new technologies and to gain
some experience and insight into a possible PhD research topic.  The
move would also have me working with a PhD who could possibly help guide
me into my next transition.  After a few rounds of interviewing, I made
the switch:  I decided to move to Coldlight.

So far, I've been right.  I've learned several new technologies, such as
`Amazon Web Services <http://aws.amazon.com/>`__ and
`Hadoop <http://hadoop.apache.org/>`__.  I've started learning about
different machine learning algorithms by poring through different
implementations and papers.  Sure, I occasionally get bogged down in
busy-work and get overloaded.  Overall, though, I feel like I've been
growing.

As an added bonus, I've been able to usher in some practices and
technologies of my own.  I've introduced my team to proper SVN usage,
Maven, some pretty cool Eclipse plugins, and a few other things.  I'm
directly responsible for some of our process improvement initiatives and
for automating some of our development headaches.

Feels good, man.
