I decided a bit ago that it was time to clean house.  I have a lot of
old tech stuff that I have been holding onto for quite some time.  The
majority of it was still in good working order, which is why I was so
hesitant to let it go.  Instead of throwing it all away or keeping it in
my closet, I decided to\ `eBay <http://myworld.ebay.com/bstempi>`__ a
bunch of it off.

All in all, it's been quite the pleasant experience.  I've sold an item
on eBay before, but this was my first time selling a ton of crap.
 Posting the items was easy once I had taken a few pictures.  Getting
messages and notifications was easy using the `eBay Android
app <http://mobile.ebay.com/android/ebay-on-android>`__.  Shipping was
easy because most of my items were small, so I just defaulted to using
the `USPS <https://www.usps.com/>`__ flat rate boxes (especially since
the boxes were free!).  The USPS allows you to print out your own labels
and to save a few cents (which add up) for not making them do it in
their retail locations.  Once I had everything packed and labeled, I
just had to walk it down to the Post Office, which is all of 5 minutes
away, drop it off, and use my eBay app to mark the items as shipped.

Pretty awesome!

Once I got the hang of the process, it became pretty fun.  There are
some other things I'm trying to get rid of, so I'll be selling for a
while.  eBay even gave me a gold star!
