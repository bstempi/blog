Every year, the `CIS department <http://www.temple.edu/cis>`__ (College
of Science and Technology, Temple University) hosts the Future of
Computing competition.  For graduate students, it's an opportunity to
show off some of their research.  For undergrads, it's a chance to show
off some of their projects or some of the cool things that they've
cooked up in their spare time.  Everyone brings in a 36" x 54" poster
and has the option of providing a demo.  This year had a pretty good
turnout and had some very impressive projects.

Since my research partner is a graduate student and I'm an undergrad, we
were forced to split our project.  Vladimir created a poster about his
prediction algorithms and the possible uses they have.  Mine was about
the use of GIS systems to create some of the data models that Vladimir
needed and the practical application of his results.  In short, I
created a web application that will allow you to click on any two
sensors within our road network and can give you a shortest path route
from point to point.  I have yet to finish this, but the end goal is to
use Vladimir's predictions to weight each segment by travel time so that
the user ends up with the shortest path by travel time.  In the end,
Vladimir took second place in his division and I tied for third in the
undergrad division with Steve Palumbo.
