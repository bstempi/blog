I've never written a post about it, but if you read the "About Me"
section, you'll see that I teach a few different technologies to high
school students (I know:  who'd trust me with kids?! :p).  I wanted to
write about two things:  Our recent trip to our regional competition at
`Bowie State University <http://www.bowiestate.edu/>`__ and our search
for volunteers.

| First thing's first:  Regionals
|  On Saturday, I took 3 kids from `my
  class <http://hscc.bdpaphilly.org>`__ down to Bowie State to compete
  in the regional HSCC competition (I'd insert a link here, but sadly I
  can't find a story that has a permalink...boo!).  For those of you who
  don't know anything about our competition, here's a rundown:

-  There's 3 sections

   -  Written

      -  For this section, the students are put in a room with a 200
         question multiple choice test.  They have 15 minutes to get as
         many correct answer as possible.  The questions range in topic
         from general computer knowledge to BDPA history to programming
         specifics.  Each students completes their own test.

   -  Oral

      -  In this section, each team competes as a unit.  They are put
         into a room with other students and play a Jeopardy (for lack
         of a better analogy) styled game.  They must, as a team, answer
         one question in each of 5 different categories.  There are some
         special rules about stealing questions, etc.

   -  Programming

      -  This is the big enchilada.  The students will be handed a spec
         that details an on-line application.  They are free to program
         it in whichever platform they please (JSP, ASP.NET, classic
         ASP, or PHP).  The web application always needs access to a
         MySQL database.  Along with knowing how to program the front
         end, back end, and database, they must also be able to start
         and stop their own services.  They are given one computer (with
         no internet connection), some paper, and 6 or 7 hours to
         complete the problem.

This year, we have an all-rookie team.  To date, they've only received
training for the Programming section of the competition.  Fortunately
for me, these kids are resilient and motivated.  Despite their
rookie-like score, they are more dedicated than ever to conquer this
challenge.  For those of you who are interested, we'll be competing at
the `BDPA National Conference <http://bdpa.org/conf-2010.php>`__ at the
end of July.

| My call for volunteers:
|  I was fortunate this year.  I had a class full of rookies and a few
  dedicated BDPA members (`Byron
  Mayes <http://www.facebook.com/bcmayes>`__ and Norman Williams) who
  were there to help students complete their assignments.  This year, I
  won't be so lucky.  I still have great volunteers, but I'll have a
  different challenge:  multiple classes.  I'll have incoming rookies
  that will need a rookie instructor and returning kids that need a more
  advanced curriculum.  As we take on more kids, we also need help doing
  administrative duties, such as organizing end-of-the-year events,
  sending home report cards, and keeping in touch with parents.

I'm asking for help.

If you like working with high school kids, teaching, and technology,
then you might be able to help out.  I've posted a couple of `volunteer
listings <http://www.idealist.org/if/i/en/av/Org/215974-135/c>`__ on
`idealist.org <http://www.idealist.org>`__.  If you think you might be
interested, follow the first link (the volunteer listings one) and see
if it sounds right for you.  If so, follow the instructions for
applying.  Even if it doesn't sound like its for you but you still want
to help in some way, please contact me.  We can use all of the help we
can get.

Either way, wish us luck at nationals!
