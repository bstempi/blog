I've never mentioned it here before, but for the last 2-ish years, I've
been the webmaster of Temple University's `GenEd
website <http://www.temple.edu/gened>`__.  The site was originally
developed by Temple University's `Computer
Services <http://www.temple.edu/cs>`__ group.  I took over the
maintenance and have only done small things with it -- add new videos,
replace some files, change text here and there, etc.  Nothing too
exciting.  Back when I first started, the (then) director of General
Education, Terry Halbert, shared her vision of the website with me.  She
envisioned a place where students, faculty, and the community could all
interact.  She imagined a place to support and eventually become the
Philadelphia Experience (PEX) Passport (the Passport is a booklet of
discount or free admission tickets to several Philadelphia museums,
venues, and historic sites).  She wanted a place that would showcase the
wonderful things that were happening in General Education courses and to
promote the Philadelphia Experience.  At the time, I suggested moving to
a `CMS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system>`__ of
some sort, like `Drupal <http://drupal.org/>`__ or
`Joomla <http://www.joomla.org/>`__.

That day has come.  GenEd recently received a grant to redesign their
website.  As per the recommendation from a few people from the `MIS
Department <http://community.mis.temple.edu/>`__, which hails from
Temple's `Fox School of Business <http://fox.temple.edu/>`__, we will be
building a `WordPress <http://wordpress.org/>`__ website over the summer
months.  The MIS department's website runs WordPress, so they've given
it a very positive recommendation and offered to help with the
implementation.  At the moment, we're still nailing down the specs, but
we're hoping to have this completed in time for the incoming class to
see.

I can't say much more other than, "I'm excited!"  This will be a big
feather in my cap.

| About GenEd:
|  At Temple University, we don't have a "core" -- we have GenEd.  They
  define and develop the classes that students have to take to satisfy
  various general education requirements.  As a result, this department
  in one way or another touches virtually every single student that
  comes through our University.  In addition to the courses that it
  develops, GenEd is also responsible developing the Philadelphia
  Experience -- a set of courses and resources to help students take
  advantage of and learn from the City of Brotherly Love.  They've also
  developed the PEX Passport, a collection of free or discounted tickets
  that allow students to explore the city for little or no money.  This
  Passport has also been integrated into some of the classes offered at
  Temple and is used to take students outside of the classroom and right
  into the environment.
