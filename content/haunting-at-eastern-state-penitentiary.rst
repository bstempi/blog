So, where have I been?

I've been working as an actor at `Eastern State
Penitentiary <http://www.easternstate.org/>`__'s "`Terror Behind the
Walls <http://www.easternstate.org/halloween>`__\ " attraction. It's a
lot of work going from a full-time job during the day then down to ESP
at night, but it's been worth it. Acting has been a ton of fun!
Unfortunately, this means some of my projects have slipped.

Once the haunt is over (we go back to weekend shows after October), I'll
be resuming my work. Looking at my list of blog posts reminds me that I
have a lot to do and write about. I've been making some good progress on
my GIS work, but I have other things to pick up. I also want to work on
some 0AD stuff, resume work on my on-line D&D character sheet app, and I
have another project that I'm not willing to talk about yet.

Hopefully coming back to some of my projects after the haunt will give
me some new ideas or motivation. Â I've lacked quite a bit of coding
motivation for the last several months (probably because I code all day
at work), so I'm hoping this little break will kick-start things for me
and help me get excited to get back to work.
