Back when I started my `GIS research
project <http://www.brianstempin.com/projects/traffic-research-project/>`__,
I purchased a used computer from Temple University's `Computer
Recycling Center <http://www.temple.edu/cs/crc/>`__.  To be more
specific, I purchased a `Dell Optiplex GX270
SFF <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_OptiPlex#Models.2C_in_relative_chronological_order>`__.
 It runs a 2.x GHz Pentium 4 and came with 512 MB of RAM (later upgraded
to 1 GB).

Shortly after purchasing it, I installed
`Folding@Home <http://folding.stanford.edu>`__ so that it could
contribute to the `ACM's F@H Community
 Service <http://www.brianstempin.com/projects/temple-acm%e2%80%99s-foldinghome-project/>`__
effort.  My friend `Tim Henry <http://timjhenry.com>`__ thought that the
machine would die from a heat stroke.  This model is known for blowing
its power supplies and for leaking capacitors.  I thought it would hold
up, so I decided to make a bet out of it.  If it lasted a year, then Tim
would have to buy 2 tickets to a heavy metal concert and take me.  If
the machine failed within a year, I'd have to purchase the tickets.  The
bet was on.

I purchased the machine sometime in September, so the machine had to
last until 1SEP2010.  I had a scare when the CPU fan died a few days ago
--  I thought this might put me out of the race.  After replacing it,
Tim said that this did not constitute losing -- only a dead processor,
dead power supply, or malfunctioning capacitor qualified.  This was
great -- I was still in the running!

...until I noticed something.  After replacing the CPU fan, I noticed
that the power supply fan was not turning.  After getting very hot, the
fan finally loosened up and started turning.  This is how I left the
machine this past Saturday.  It's now the Wednesday after and my machine
appears to have turned itself off.  The power light on the front was
flashing orange.  I'm guessing that there was a 'heat event,' so the
machine shut itself down.  My power supply's good, but the machine won't
run for multiple days in a row.  Go figure that it dies with 5 or 6
weeks of winning the bet.

And with that, I must admit defeat.  I'll get you Mr. Henry!
