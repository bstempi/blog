When I was the VP of the `Temple ACM <http://acm.temple.edu>`__, `Tim
Henry <http://timjhenry.com/>`__ and I headed up an effort to get other
ACMers to participate in the
`Folding@Home <http://folding.stanford.edu/>`__ project.  In short, this
project is a way to donate spare CPU cycles to scientists working on
computationally difficult problems.

A few weeks ago, I found myself bothered by how little I've put my
`Linode <http://www.linode.com/>`__ to use.  For a while, I was using it
quite a bit, and then life came along and gave me an upper-cut.  So,
I've decided to go back to donating CPU time to scientific projects.
 I'm using `BOINC <http://boinc.berkeley.edu/>`__ since it allows me to
donate to several projects at once and has a pretty awesome Linux
client.

If you have spare CPU time floating around, I'd encourage you to do the
same!
