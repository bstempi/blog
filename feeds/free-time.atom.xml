Well, it's time to fix that. I've done a lot of out-of-band development and side projects since I've last written, but nothing that I've published until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one of my side projects I'm using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi"&gt;Raspberry Pi 3B …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Holy moly, it's been a while since I've written! Well, it's time to fix that. I've done a lot of out-of-band development and side projects since I've last written, but nothing that I've published until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one of my side projects I'm using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi"&gt;Raspberry Pi 3B+&lt;/a&gt; to drive some LEDs. For this particular project, I'm using the &lt;a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds"&gt;DotStar&lt;/a&gt; LEDs. They're connected to my Pi via SPI. I soldered some wires to a test strip and have those connected to the &lt;a href="https://de.pinout.xyz/pinout/spi"&gt;SPI0 pins&lt;/a&gt; via a JST connector that I've plugged in the Pi's header pins. Adafruit produces some pretty &lt;a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DotStar"&gt;easy to use Python drivers&lt;/a&gt;, so programming these LEDs is easy enough. But I want to do more than just set individual LED values. I want to be able to produce and play animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I needed to develop a new library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Requirements&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I specifically wanted to be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programmatically create animation sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serialize animation sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play animations, preferably on multiple boards, but primarily on the Pi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy-peasy. I need some data structures, an interface and/or classes for serialization, and an interface and/or classes for rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sectional-Art/pixelbuf-pi-animation"&gt;implementation on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and find my &lt;a href="https://pixelbuf-pi-animation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;documentation on Read The Docs&lt;/a&gt;. As of right now, it's built on top of &lt;a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Pixelbuf"&gt;Adafruit's Pixelbuf library&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably, this library should work with any of their drivers that are built on it. As of this writing, it has only been tested with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DotStar"&gt;DotStar driver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Examples&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project documentation already covers the specifics, so I figured I'd leave the rest of this blog post for fun examples and some examples of things I've done with this library so far. Here is a link to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sectional-Art/pixelbuf-pi-animation/tree/c37f4905bfef5228321503e9ede083887d83b931/notebooks/examples"&gt;Jupyter Notebooks used as of the time of this writing&lt;/a&gt;. While the contents of that link will never change, please keep in mind that the library may have evolved by time you see this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the example notebooks, make sure you have all the stuff you need for your particular LED setup, this library, and &lt;code&gt;jupyter&lt;/code&gt;. If you checkout or download the notebooks, you can &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the directory containing the notebooks and run &lt;code&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/code&gt; in order to start a notebook server. From there, you can run, modify, or create new notebooks and experiments. I find this particularly convenient since my Pi is headless. It gives me an easy way to test and execute code on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test all of this stuff, I've constructed the world's most sophisticated testing rig. It includes some 3d printed feet, a spare DIN rail, a piece of corrugated plastic, and some hot glue. As I'm sure you can tell from the photo, absolutely no mistakes were made and everything is perfectly square and level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Absolutely awful test rig" src="http://brianstempin.com/images/led-testing-rig-300x225.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://brianstempin.com/images/led-testing-rig-original.jpg"&gt;Full resolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Runway Guard Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full writeup of this one can be found in &lt;code&gt;Programatic Generation of Animations.ipynb&lt;/code&gt;. It mimics the lights that are found at the entrance of runways at larger airports. This isn't exactly what the one that I'm thinking of looks like, but it's close. All it's missing is a fade-in-and-out before wig-wagging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The color is a bit washed out in the video, but here's my take on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuwZl3LMZfo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Christmas Themed Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When putting some of these examples together, it was Thanksgiving weekend. With &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YekZoouZn9E"&gt;Chrimbus&lt;/a&gt; right around the corner, I thought I'd add my own Christmas animation. The way this works is that to start, it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selects a random color from red, green, or white&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selects a random brightness for that color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selects a random direction for that brightness (brighter or dimmer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each pixel, it will make it brighter or dimmer until it "dies" (is as bright or as dim as it can go). For that pixel, the random process repeats. This generates a random-looking animation that can be looped easily without an obvious-looking loop point. It also has an interesting "twinkle" effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IfF_HK_ofZo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too Lazy to Write Something for the Rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further commentary, I'll post the rest of the videos I produced. Each video contains a link back to the exact Jupyter Notebook that produced it, allowing you to do the same thing for &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; it and do something else interesting. If you wanna talk about it, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sectional-Art/pixelbuf-pi-animation/discussions"&gt;contact me here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

originally started this blog, WordPress just made the most sense.  It was easy to install, easy to maintain, had plenty
of skins and plugins available, and just worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why the departure?  The reason is two-fold:  &lt;a href="http://www.bluehost.com/"&gt;bluehost&lt;/a&gt; is slow, and I don't write often
enough to justify the WordPress maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluehost being slow was definitely the biggest factor for me.  I helped develop a WordPress site for &lt;a href="http://play0ad.com/"&gt;0 A.D.&lt;/a&gt;
and it runs much, much faster than my blog.  The 0 A.D. site has a lot more plugins, themeing, traffic, and activity than
my blog, yet it runs tons faster.  It's not that they use some sort of super-servers or anything like that.  I think it's
because bluehost just does a crappy job at making sure that their machines aren't shared between too many different sites.
The convenience just isn't worth the bad impression that a slow site makes on visitors (some of which are potential employers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, WordPress upgrades and major releases cost me more time than writing does.  If I can't be bothered with making sure that
my theme and plugins work with the newest release, then why bother?  This also means that hosting isn't an option for me,
either.  I definitely don't want to have to worry about my VPS getting &lt;a href="http://funnystack.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Funny-Weightlifting-40.jpg"&gt;b0rked&lt;/a&gt;
because of the latest 0-day exploit.  It's just not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Static Pages to the Rescue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static pages solve all of these problems.  I don't have to worry about updates or server vulnerabilities.  I don't have
to worry about 0-days coming along and murdering my content.  I don't have to worry about speed.  Everything is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also cheaper.  I'm currently having my blog hosted via &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; for free, but I
could have just as easily hosted it on S3 and Cloudfront for less than a dollar a month since I don't see a huge amount
of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tooling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do I go about making static pages?  I use a tool called &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.  It's pretty
similar to &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, except that it's written in Python and not Ruby.  I settled on Pelican because
I have familiarity with the Python stack and because I happen to already have a bunch of Python stuff installed.
It also has some nice tools for porting content from WordPress.  The only thing that I had to handle after porting the
content was manually porting the images and fixing links.  That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing is pretty simple, too.  Once I generate the content, I just use &lt;a href="https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import"&gt;ghp-import&lt;/a&gt;
to check it into GitHub, and wa-la!  My content is posted.  I could use something like TravisCI to do this for me, but
it's a bit of a pain to have to find a way to share credentials with a build service like that.  It's just simpler for me
to run the one extra command after a commit and push to publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how much faster and easier it is to maintain my blog.  Getting Pelican &amp;amp; co set up might sound intimidating, but
it's not.  It's very much worth it.  I should have done this a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Free Time"></category><category term="Python"></category></entry><entry><title>Update to my Vindinium Client</title><link href="http://brianstempin.com/2014/10/20/update-to-my-vindinium-client/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-20T22:27:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-10-20T22:27:00-04:00</updated><author><name>bstempi</name></author><id>tag:brianstempin.com,2014-10-20:/2014/10/20/update-to-my-vindinium-client/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://brianstempin.com/2014/09/28/vindinium/"&gt;previously

&lt;p&gt;Well, I have something that I think is useful: &amp;nbsp;a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client/releases/tag/1.0.0"&gt;1.0.0

&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different interfaces for writing a bot:

&lt;p&gt;There are two different interfaces for writing a bot:

and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client/blob/1.0.0/src/main/java/com/brianstempin/vindiniumclient/bot/advanced/AdvancedBot.java"&gt;AdvancedBot&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;The SimpleBot interface is just a Java representation of the GameState
as defined by Vindinium. &amp;nbsp;As such, the map is represented as a string,
forcing each bot to do its own parsing, etc. &amp;nbsp;AdvancedBot takes this
further with an AdvancedGameState, which provides a board graph and
provides a hash map for indexing the players, mines, and pubs by
position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each bot package also comes with a callable to run the game loop. &amp;nbsp;The
Callable will handle parsing the game state, invoking the bot, and
communication. &amp;nbsp;Once a bot is written, it just needs to be instantiated
and passed to the appropriate bot runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ease of use, a Main class is provided that can run a bot on the
class path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="example-bots"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example Bots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vindinium.org/ai/dmyaf50l"&gt;my bot's score&lt;/a&gt;, I'm no
bot expert. &amp;nbsp;Still, I included some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SimpleMurderBot does one thing: &amp;nbsp;it shanks. &amp;nbsp;It does a simple Dijkstra
search on the board and looks for the closest bot to stab. &amp;nbsp;If it gets
low on health, it'll look for the nearest tavern. &amp;nbsp;It does not
discriminate or take mines. &amp;nbsp;It literally just goes after the nearest
bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AdvancedMurderBot is a little more interesting. &amp;nbsp;It also uses Dijkstra
to do its search, but its decisioning is more advanced. &amp;nbsp;After reading
about Behavior Trees, I decided to try my hand at implementing them.
&amp;nbsp;Because this game isn't real-time, the implementation was much simpler
than some of the examples I came across. &amp;nbsp;I have a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client/blob/1.0.0/src/main/java/com/brianstempin/vindiniumclient/bot/advanced/murderbot/Decision.java"&gt;Decision&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;class
that, given some state, will return some move. &amp;nbsp;The state and move are
generics so that other bot designers might use different game state
types. &amp;nbsp;As an example of why someone might want to do this, I created an
inner class within AdvancedMurderBot that contains the AdvancedGameState
and a Dijkstra search. &amp;nbsp;This enriched game state is what I pass to each
of my decisioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my implementation, I wrote several Decision nodes, each of which
might return a move itself or decide to delegate to some other decision
node. &amp;nbsp;The nodes could be assembled any which way. &amp;nbsp;In my case, I chose
to assemble them as a DAG in order to make them easier to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bots also contain some pretty bad flaws. &amp;nbsp;The biggest of these is
definitely the routing. &amp;nbsp;SimpleMurderBot will simply try to walk through
other bots and doesn't consider them obstacles. &amp;nbsp;AdvancedMurderBot will
avoid other bots that aren't targets, but it won't walk far enough
around them to avoid a fight. &amp;nbsp;Rather, it will just walk next to them,
provoking a strike. &amp;nbsp;Another interesting flaw is the lack of loop
detection. &amp;nbsp;Both bots are vulnerable to getting into infinite loops at
the pub with other bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="go-forth-and-extend"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go Forth and Extend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my README that I think the AdvancedGameState still leaves
something to be desired. &amp;nbsp;I think that my routing is pretty crummy, too,
so I'll be working on those things for my next release. &amp;nbsp;If you spot a
flaw, something that you think just sucks, or an improvement, feel free
to send me a pull request. &amp;nbsp;I'd be happy to have your improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Is Vindinium?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vindinium is an AI competition. &amp;nbsp;Its a game that is played exclusively
by bots. &amp;nbsp;You could create a bot that takes input from a human player,
but the required response time makes it impractical. &amp;nbsp;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vindinium.org/doc"&gt;game
rules&lt;/a&gt; are fairly simple, which makes the
barrier-of-entry fairly low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-the-rub"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's the Rub?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's object model is not easy to deal with. &amp;nbsp;The entire map state
is sent back to you each time, so its up to the client to determine
which parts are mutable vs. immutable. &amp;nbsp;The map is represented as a
string and an integer that tells you the length of one side of the map
(all maps are square). &amp;nbsp;Without a good client, the bot has to manually
parse the map string, build graphs to represent the map, etc. &amp;nbsp;This is
work that shouldn't need to be repeated for each bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-wrote-a-simple-client"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Wrote a Simple Client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyword in the title is, &amp;quot;simple.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;I wrote a client (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client"&gt;posted on
Github&lt;/a&gt;) that handles
the HTTP and JSON bits using Google's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/"&gt;HTTP
client&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/"&gt;GSON&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. &amp;nbsp;The
game state passed to the Bot interface is just a Java representation of
the GameState class. &amp;nbsp;Its as bare-bones as ones gets and it has the
problems described in the previous paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is to write a few more advanced clients. &amp;nbsp;One of the things I'd
like to achieve is to have a game state that's much easier to deal with.
&amp;nbsp;It'd be nice if the game map was presented to the bot as a graph along
with a few hash maps to tell the bot where the taverns, players, and
chests are. &amp;nbsp;Another thing I would like to handle is mutltithreading.
&amp;nbsp;The client should respond with a default move should the bot be taking
too long to calculate a move. &amp;nbsp;The bot should also be provided some
background threads to do calculations, such as forecasting and
pathfinding, while the other bots are moving. &amp;nbsp;Ideally, I'll add these
things to my current project as additional options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

low on health, it'll run for beer. &amp;nbsp;Thats it...super simple. &amp;nbsp;I would
like to write a bot with a more serious strategy, but for now,
SimpleMurderBot is pretty fun to work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vindinium.org/starters"&gt;starter packs&lt;/a&gt;,

catch on.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/cloudmarketwatch.com"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/bstempi/projecteuler"&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;When I
started with PHP, I wasn't using anything in the way of a framework. &amp;nbsp;No
MVC-bits, no ORM, no serializer, no dependency management. &amp;nbsp;Nothing.
&amp;nbsp;This is wildly different than my Java development experience, where I
regularly depend on things like Maven for dependency management, Guice
or Spring for dependency injection, and Camel or Hadoop for an
application framework. &amp;nbsp;Where was this stuff for PHP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="it-s-there"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's There&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of it was there when I first started with PHP, but a lot of it has
been vastly improved since then. &amp;nbsp;The fact is that I never knew these
types of tools existed 10 years ago. &amp;nbsp;Now that I'm going back and doing
some PHP development, I'm rediscovering the PHP ecosystem. &amp;nbsp;I'm finding
some analogs for my familiar Java stack and some new tools that I wish I
had elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="symfony2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symfony2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had read a little bit about the original
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://symfony.com/"&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt; a few years back, but I never had much
of a chance to use it. &amp;nbsp;I started writing a few one-off web apps and
decided that I wanted something lighter weight than Java. &amp;nbsp;I remembered
dealing with Symfony, so I took at look to see if it was something that
would suit me. &amp;nbsp;Since I'd last used it, Symfony2 had some out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an awesome piece of software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symfony2 is an absolute pleasure to use. &amp;nbsp;It just kind of makes sense.
&amp;nbsp;I think the most impressive bit about it is that it ties together so
many other tools and does so in a way that allows you to switch out
different tools. &amp;nbsp;It just &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; better than the Java stacks I had
worked with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="composer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Composer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getcomposer.org/"&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt; is one of the de facto
dependency management systems in the PHP world and is the one used by
Symfony2. &amp;nbsp;In short: &amp;nbsp;it's simple. &amp;nbsp;It has a JSON file that lists the
library and version dependencies. &amp;nbsp;Thats it...thats enough to get
someone started. &amp;nbsp;It also has a plugin and scripting capabilities like
Maven does, except that it doesn't feel anywhere near as clunky. &amp;nbsp;It
works pretty well and tends to be much less verbose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="friends-of-symfony"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friends of Symfony&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony"&gt;FOS bundles&lt;/a&gt; are a pretty
awesome addition to Symfony. &amp;nbsp;Specifically, the rest bundle is
top-notch. &amp;nbsp;It just kind of handles routing, serialization, and
validation with relatively little input from me. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch18s02.html"&gt;Spring does
this&lt;/a&gt;,
and I've used Spring for providing data via a RESTful service before.
&amp;nbsp;While the FOSRest bundle has some documentation problems, it was still
much more of a pleasure than dealing with the setup and verbosity of
Spring. &amp;nbsp;Routing in particular is a bit painful with the version of
Spring that I used. &amp;nbsp;Symfony, instead of forcing me to annotate every
method with the URL, allows me to extend a controller class and to
create the methods that I want. &amp;nbsp;If I follow a simple naming convention,
it just works. &amp;nbsp;If I want to override the default URL scheme, I can. &amp;nbsp;It
just feels more powerful, and I don't have to wait for a servlet to
restart between tests. &amp;nbsp;I feel like I'm just sitting around and waiting
less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="doctrine"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doctrine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/"&gt;Doctrine&lt;/a&gt; is the default ORM
packaged with Symfony2. &amp;nbsp;If you've used
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hibernate.org/"&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt;, then Doctrine should seem
familiar. &amp;nbsp;For the most part, they're very similar. &amp;nbsp;They both hydrate
and persist object graphs; they both have a query language; they both
have some sort of caching. &amp;nbsp;My big beef with Hibernate was its dealings
with entity relationships. &amp;nbsp;I felt like Hibernate or the documentation
(I'm not sure which one, and I'm too lazy to find out) made figuring out
which entity should (or did) own a relationship to some other entity a
pain. &amp;nbsp;A royal pain. &amp;nbsp;I remember spending days on that in previous
projects. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I was being thick back then, but I don't remember
having those pains with Doctrine. &amp;nbsp;I felt like the documentation was
much more concise and that relationship management was much easier to
follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="performance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent this entire post gushing over how I've started to really like
Symfony and how I'm getting back into PHP development. &amp;nbsp;The down side?
&amp;nbsp;Performance. &amp;nbsp;Unlike Java, there's no PHP process that sits around and
listens for requests. &amp;nbsp;Also, threading is not a common practice in PHP.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://us2.php.net/pthreads"&gt;Threading exists&lt;/a&gt;, but few use it.
&amp;nbsp;Each request is a process or comes from a process pool. &amp;nbsp;Each requests
is basically an application restart, which can get expensive and is not
great for performance. &amp;nbsp;Event CLI tools like composer can seem slow at
times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there are solutions on the horizon (I haven't tried any yet).
&amp;nbsp;Tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/reactphp/react"&gt;Reactor&lt;/a&gt; exist and
claim to erase this cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="its-just-satisfying"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Its Just...Satisfying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. &amp;nbsp;For whatever reason, despite some of the (large) down-sides
of PHP, working with is has just been satisfying. &amp;nbsp;I don't know if I'm
actually any more productive, but I certainly feel like it. &amp;nbsp;Anywho,
here's to doing more of my side projects in PHP and to seeing its
ecosystem continue to evolve and grow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

(eww, I know, forgive me). &amp;nbsp;I opted to run this environment in a VM so
that I don't have to pollute my gaming rig with all kinds of tools,
patches, bit-rot, etc. &amp;nbsp;So, after firing up VirtualBox and getting
Windows 7 installed, it was time to get some tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the part I hate. &amp;nbsp;Manually installing tools SUCKS. &amp;nbsp;Call me
spoiled, but I enjoy not having to deal with that in Linux.
&amp;nbsp;Specifically, I'm spoiled by APT. &amp;nbsp;With one line and a few minutes, I
can have an entire LAMP setup. &amp;nbsp;No such luck in Windows unless someone
makes a product out of it (like the WAMP product by Alter Way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enter-the-tool"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter the Tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd heard of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chocolatey.org/"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; while I was working
at Coldlight, but I didn't have any time to spend with it. &amp;nbsp;Now that I'm
working on a new project and that I'm on my own time, I was free to do
as I pleased. &amp;nbsp;So I did;&amp;nbsp;I tried it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation was simple. &amp;nbsp;I copy/pasted the PowerShell one-liner into my
console and let it do it's thing. &amp;nbsp;I had to install the .NET 4
framework, but that was being installed anyway by Visual Studio, so it
was already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for packages was just as easy. &amp;nbsp;Their website is pretty
awesome and allows you to simply browse or search. &amp;nbsp;I found several of
my favorite tools, such as Notepad++, Cygwin, Sysinternals, VLC,
Greenshot, and several others there. &amp;nbsp;They even had a bunch of the
Microsoft Express tools there! Unlike APT, I still can't list a bunch of
packages on one line. &amp;nbsp;I can, however, do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
cinst package1; cinst package2; cinst package3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is close enough. &amp;nbsp;It allows me to type in one line, hit enter, and
walk away. &amp;nbsp;Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided a while back that it'd be cool to do some graph analysis on
the English Wikipedia database. &amp;nbsp;I want to study how &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; the
articles are. &amp;nbsp;I also want to collect some statistics about the text of
the articles themselves, their references, and some …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;...but I did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided a while back that it'd be cool to do some graph analysis on
the English Wikipedia database. &amp;nbsp;I want to study how &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; the
articles are. &amp;nbsp;I also want to collect some statistics about the text of
the articles themselves, their references, and some other fun numbers.
&amp;nbsp;At first glance, Wikipedia makes this easy. &amp;nbsp;WikiMedia (the group
behind Wikipedia) &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/"&gt;publishes their database
dumps&lt;/a&gt; so that others can download
entire copies of any Wikipedia site in any language. &amp;nbsp;All of the dumps
provided are SQL dumps, with one big exception: &amp;nbsp;the page text. &amp;nbsp;In
order to maintain backward and forward compatibility, MediaWiki began
producing XML dumps a while back. &amp;nbsp;This XML file can be used to generate
the whole database, but to do so would mean that a Wiki engine would
have to scan and evaluate the text of every single article in order to
build some of the relationship tables. &amp;nbsp;Ew. &amp;nbsp;Luckily, MediaWiki provides
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:MWDumper"&gt;a tool for parsing this
data&lt;/a&gt;, so easy-peasy,
right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="first-challenge-huge-sql-dumps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Challenge: &amp;nbsp;Huge SQL Dumps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's handle the easy part first. &amp;nbsp;I downloaded a full dump and spun
up a virtual machine in Xen to handle the processing. &amp;nbsp;Since MySQL is
good enough to run Wikipedia, I figured that it was good enough for me,
too. &amp;nbsp;For the sake of completeness, I did not start with a blank
database. &amp;nbsp;I downloaded a copy of MediaWiki 1.9 and used the included
SQL script (maintenance/tables.sql) to create a blank MediaWiki
database. &amp;nbsp;Being lazy, I started running commands like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
zcat some_huge_file.sql.gz | mysql -u me -p en_wikipedia
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: that would work...if you wanted to wait several
years. &amp;nbsp;Why was it so slow? &amp;nbsp;Well, the dumps provided aren't wrapped in
a transaction or anything like that, so the database reindexes after
each &lt;em&gt;individual **insert.**&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; Slow is an understatement. &amp;nbsp;To fix this,
I wrote and zipped two small SQL scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;preimport.sql&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
SET autocommit=0;
SET unique_checks=0;
SET foreign_key_checks=0;
BEGIN;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;postimport.sql&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
COMMIT;
SET autocommit=1;
SET unique_checks=1;
SET foreign_key_checks=1;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's going on here? &amp;nbsp;On preimport.sql, the first line is pretty
self&amp;nbsp;explanatory: &amp;nbsp;I don't want my queries
to&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/commit.html"&gt;auto-commit&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Rather, I want to chose when and if they are committed. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, I
wanted to disable
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_unique_checks"&gt;unique_checks&lt;/a&gt;
during the import. &amp;nbsp;I was using MyISAM tables, so this doesn't do much
for me, but those of you out there who may want to use InnoDB tables
will benefit greatly from this. &amp;nbsp;Likewise, I next disable
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_foreign_key_checks"&gt;foreign_key_checks&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Lastly, I use the BEGIN key word to start a transaction. &amp;nbsp;This will
prevent MySQL from calculating indexes until the entire data set has
been read. &amp;nbsp;As you can see, postimport is just the exact opposite of
preimport. &amp;nbsp;I also mentioned that I zipped them. &amp;nbsp;Why? &amp;nbsp;So I could do
this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
zcat preimport.sql.gz some_huge_file.sql.gz postimport.sql.gz | mysql -u me -p en_wikipedia
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That statement will, all in the same MySQL session, read the contents of
preimport.sql, the huge SQL file, and then postimport.sql. &amp;nbsp;If you're
cool, you can even wrap that whole mess with the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/01/time-command-examples/"&gt;*time*&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;command
so that you can get an exact time of how long it takes to run each
import. &amp;nbsp;All in all, most of my imports ran in only a few hours. &amp;nbsp;On on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="second-challenge-that-huge-xml-file"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Challenge: &amp;nbsp;That Huge XML File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, we have just about all of the metadata we could want.
&amp;nbsp;What about the real stuff? &amp;nbsp;You know -- the content? &amp;nbsp;Oh yes, that!
&amp;nbsp;Well, that's where things get a bit sticky. &amp;nbsp;There 3 common options
that I've found for importing the data from the
enwiki-sometimestamp-pages-articles.xml.bz2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;importDump.php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xml2sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mwdumper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;importDump.php is a tool built into MediaWiki. &amp;nbsp;It can produce an entire
database from one of these XML dumps. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, it's really slow.
&amp;nbsp;It's not recommended for use on larger data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xml2sql is an ANSI C program can can extract page and text information,
but not any of the metadata. &amp;nbsp;It's currently not maintained and it's not
officially supported by MediaWiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mwdumper is the official MediaWiki tool. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, it's not well
supported, either, but it turned out to be my best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to read the XML dump, I went with mwdumper since it's the
official tool and it's written in a language that I'm quite dangerous
with. &amp;nbsp;The first thing to note is that the most up-to-date version is
not available as a binary. &amp;nbsp;I had to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/mwdumper/"&gt;download the
source&lt;/a&gt;
and build it myself. &amp;nbsp;If you're familiar with the SVN-Maven-Java stack
(or you use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts"&gt;STS&lt;/a&gt;) then
this is pretty simple and straight-forward. &amp;nbsp;I'm not going to cover how
to build the software here. &amp;nbsp;I assume that either the reader is able to
do this already or that there are instructions for doing so on the
project's page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was able to produce an executable JAR, I bumped into three
problems. &amp;nbsp;The first one involves the file's format. The file that
MediaWiki produces is a valid bzip file, but for whatever reason,
mwdumper does not recognize it as such. &amp;nbsp;You can either unzip it first,
or use a pipe. &amp;nbsp;I wasn't very creative, so I first unzipped it, and then
ran this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
java -server -jar ../mwdumper-1.16-jar-with-dependencies.jar --format=sql:1.5 temp2.xml | gzip -vc &amp;gt; enwiki-latest-pages-articles.sql.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where temp2.xml was the unzipped version of the XML dump, and
enwiki-latest-pages-articles.sql.gz is where I want the SQL script to
go. This command will process the XML and convert it into SQL INSERT
statements and then pipe it through gzip so that your output stays
small(er). &amp;nbsp;When mwdumper is finished, we'll have a zipped SQL file that
we can handle just like we did the others in Step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is that some of the queries are larger than my MySQL
server would allow for. &amp;nbsp;To handle this, I had to modify my
/etc/mysql/my.cnf (on Ubuntu) file and change this setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
max_allowed_packet = 128M
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setting controls the maximum size of a query that the server can
receive. By default, this value is rather small. Since we'll be
importing rows that contain whole articles, this value must be raised.
The value above should work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and last problem is that mwdumper would come to a grinding
halt a little over 4 million records in. &amp;nbsp;It would throw a strange error
about UTF-8 encoding. &amp;nbsp;I didn't see anything wrong, and I didn't have
any reason to believe that the file wasn't being encoded correctly, so I
inspected the first few lines of the file and found that there was no
XML declaration. &amp;nbsp;It appears that mwdumper assumed that it was UTF-8, so
I decided to add the following header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;ISO-8859-1&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common encoding for western European languages. There might
have been characters that got mangled in the process, but I wasn't
terribly worried about the occasional character here-and-there. If you
are, then you'll need to find your own workaround for this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these 3 issues are cleared, then mwdumper will be able to produce
usable SQL that you can import. If you use the command that I provided
in step 1, you'll end up with a gzipped sql file that can be used just
like any of the other compressed SQL files in step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having this information up-front was a huge pain in the butt. I'm
also still not sure about the UTF-8 encoding issue. In retrospect, I
really don't know if the file was correctly encoded or not. At some
point, I'd like to automate this process so that imports aren't such a
hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

Bloch&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Bottom line up
front: &amp;nbsp;totally worth the read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="format"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book's format is interesting. &amp;nbsp;At first, I wasn't sure if I liked
it, but it grew on me. &amp;nbsp;The book is divided into 78 items, each one
detailing arguments for an idiom or principle. &amp;nbsp;Many times, these items
reference each other, especially when in the same group. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes this
lends itself to the temptation to skip ahead to one of the mentioned
items, but I managed to resist. &amp;nbsp;It's interesting to see how some of the
items at the very end of the book related back to ones at the very
beginning. &amp;nbsp;Forcing myself to wait to read about some of the related
items gave me time to reflect on the item at hand and to kind of put it
in the back of my mind before moving forward. &amp;nbsp;As I came across
references to earlier items, I found that the earlier items made much
more sense. &amp;nbsp;Not that they didn't make sense before, but sometimes Bloch
would write a line or two that referenced items that I hadn't covered
yet. &amp;nbsp;All of the sudden, those extra few lines here and there started
making a lot more sense. &amp;nbsp;I think he did a very good job at linking
items while allowing them to stand separate. &amp;nbsp;I didn't have to skip
ahead to understand the item at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code used in the book is often reused when possible from item to
item. &amp;nbsp;This makes it even easier to link common items together. &amp;nbsp;Because
I was already familiar with the code, I could understand why parts of it
were structured a certain way, which allowed me to focus more on the
idiom at hand. &amp;nbsp;Often in programming books, example are written to
illustrate a point in such an oversimplified fashion that they end up
violating principles earlier in the book to demonstrate the current
topic or they end up not offering enough code for a full demonstration.
&amp;nbsp;Bloch does a really good job of avoiding this. &amp;nbsp;If he demonstrates a
principle that overlaps with another one, he'll write the code such that
it adheres to both and note it accordingly. &amp;nbsp;I also like that each
principle comes with some &amp;quot;good code, bad code&amp;quot; examples. &amp;nbsp;While reading
through some of these, I couldn't help but to be reminded of &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8PhzrmBgMI"&gt;Good
Idea, Bad Idea&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; from
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs"&gt;Animaniacs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="structure-of-arguments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structure of Arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember the last time I read a book when an author provided so
much balance to their arguments. &amp;nbsp;Granted, sometimes Bloch did strongly
advocate for or against something. &amp;nbsp;In most of those cases (I say most
because I don't have enough background knowledge to make judgements on
some of them), they were warranted. &amp;nbsp;Often, each argument came with a
list of times when they were appropriate and when they were to be
avoided. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes, simple litmus-test type questions were given in
order to aid a developer in figuring out when a principle applies. &amp;nbsp;To
me, this was *the* most important content of the book. &amp;nbsp;Some of the
principles have obvious applications, but others were more obscure. &amp;nbsp;The
list of principles does me know good if I cannot make an intelligent
argument for or against one when developing a system. &amp;nbsp;I now have simple
questions that I can ask myself or others to help determine what
patterns or idioms are appropriate to apply to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="citations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't read an item without seeing several citations. &amp;nbsp;Looking at the
list of sources in the book's appendix gives the reader a sense of just
how much work and knowledge went into creating this book. &amp;nbsp;His sources
run the gamut, from items as low level as the Java specification itself
all the way up to citing himself and other best-practice authors. &amp;nbsp;This
gives the reader the tools to go deeper should they choose to. &amp;nbsp;Want to
know why certain features of the language aren't guaranteed? &amp;nbsp;Go read
spec-X! &amp;nbsp;Want to be a multi-threading wizard? &amp;nbsp;Go read guide-Y! &amp;nbsp;As a
result of this book, my next purchase will be the book that he cites on
multithreading topics (I don't remember the title off-hand). &amp;nbsp;I'm also
now curious to try my hand at going through some of the language specs.
&amp;nbsp;Way to spark interest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="final-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this book is no bible, it was effective immediately. &amp;nbsp;I was able
to easily apply some of these principles to my work and open source
programming efforts. &amp;nbsp;I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of
the language and how certain programming errors start and propagate
themselves. &amp;nbsp;I've thought of type safety issues before, but the book
took this sentiment a step further by getting me into the habit of
structuring my code so that more errors are caught at compile-time.
&amp;nbsp;This has been a great lesson in syntax, patterns, and quality
assurance. &amp;nbsp;I will be reading this book again -- it was full of gems,
and I'm eager to go back a second time and to see what else dawns on me.&lt;/p&gt;

(movies, music, etc) from my Ubuntu &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)"&gt;SMB
server&lt;/a&gt; to my TV. &amp;nbsp;Now
that I own a TV capable of high-def, I wanted more. &amp;nbsp;I also wanted to
lower my cable bill. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, XBMC does not directly support
premium video services like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.netflix.com"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Further more, the 3rd party Netflix plugins won't work for XBMC if
you're not running on a Windows or OSX machine due to the lack of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight"&gt;MS
Silverlight&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I
decided it was time to switch -- I want a device that can stream from
premium sources AND my local network. &amp;nbsp;Enter the Boxee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-boxee"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why Boxee?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing was definitely the network media streaming. &amp;nbsp;Very few
of the media center appliances have this. &amp;nbsp;I have a file server that's
full of my (legal, of course) music, movies, and TV shows that I've
acquired over the years. &amp;nbsp;I want to be able to watch those on my TV,
too. Plus, I shouldn't have to fire up my computer just to play a few
MP3s through my stereo. &amp;nbsp;If I'm going to buy something to play media to
my TV, it better handle local network media, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second biggest thing was Netflix. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to replace my cable with
something that I wouldn't get bored of. &amp;nbsp;I used to share a Netflix
account with a friend. &amp;nbsp;I remember being blown away with the selection
and quality of the media they offered. &amp;nbsp;The Netflix part of the decision
was a no brainer: &amp;nbsp;it was mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I own a high-def TV. &amp;nbsp;I wanted something that could handle
high-def resolutions. &amp;nbsp;Even if Netflix isn't full hd, it might be some
day. &amp;nbsp;Also, some of my local network content is high-def. &amp;nbsp;Not that I'm
picky about connectors, but having a box that uses
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI"&gt;HDMI&lt;/a&gt; makes life easy. One plug
to rule them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-to-love"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's to Love?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you asked! &amp;nbsp;First and foremost, the Netflix app is pretty
awesome. &amp;nbsp;It's not given me any stability issues, it's easy to use with
the remote, and the picture looks great. &amp;nbsp;Setup was a breeze. &amp;nbsp;The first
time you power it on, you're prompted to sign into a wifi network,
configure the output resolution, and a few other things. &amp;nbsp;I also like
that I get recommended content in my home screen. &amp;nbsp;As of now, it's just
free content from YouTube and a few other sources. &amp;nbsp;I'd like to see if I
can modify that, but for now it's fun. &amp;nbsp;I end up finding some really
cool short movies whenever I go flipping through the home feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote is pretty awesome. &amp;nbsp;On one side, it's a directional pad with
a select and back button. &amp;nbsp;On the other side, it's a QWERTY keyboard.
&amp;nbsp;The keyboard is really cool for searching for content. &amp;nbsp;My friend Tim
used to launch Netflix through his Wii, and typing anything of length by
using the Wiimote was a pain. &amp;nbsp;The keyboard is a cool feature. &amp;nbsp;In
addition to the remote, there's also a built-in web server. &amp;nbsp;The web
server does't put out human-readable web pages, but it does allow for
3rd party apps to control the Boxee. &amp;nbsp;For my Android phone, I found an
app called Boxee Thumb. &amp;nbsp;Basically, it auto-detects the Boxee (if you're
connected to the same network) and allows you to use swipe gestures,
soft buttons, or your phone's keyboard to control the unit. &amp;nbsp;The swipe
gestures are pretty cool -- I enjoy being able to swipe through play
lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boxee also allows for 3rd party software. &amp;nbsp;The default software
channel has 200+ apps. &amp;nbsp;You have the ability to add additional
repositories, which provide additional software. &amp;nbsp;I have yet to try any
third party channels, but I'm looking. &amp;nbsp;You can also write your own apps
and either load them onto a channel or onto a USB stick and run them
locally. &amp;nbsp;The interface is done by using HTML5/CSS3. &amp;nbsp;Python is used to
access the Boxee's functionality and can be embedded right into the HTML
to provide access to system functions. &amp;nbsp;Pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-to-hate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's to Hate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot, unfortunately. &amp;nbsp;The Boxee has a ton of great features, but
they're offset by the interface. &amp;nbsp;It simply sucks. &amp;nbsp;Most of my negative
opinion centers around the interface's instability. &amp;nbsp;If I stay in an
app, everything's golden. &amp;nbsp;As soon as I start switching apps and
switching windows, the Boxee will freeze and need a hard reset. &amp;nbsp;What a
pain! &amp;nbsp;If my phone crashed &amp;nbsp;that often, I'd throw it at someone.
&amp;nbsp;Fortunately, I don't venture from app-to-app too often, so it's
tolerable, but leaves a bad taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the interface are also rather ugly. &amp;nbsp;Local media browsing
is one of those places. &amp;nbsp;When it works right, it looks nice and is able
to pull episode, movie, and track information from the web. &amp;nbsp;When it
doesn't work, it's a pain. &amp;nbsp;Manual resolution sucks. &amp;nbsp;Some of it is my
fault for not having things properly labeled, but I should be given a
better interface (perhaps web?) for fixing unidentified media. &amp;nbsp;Also,
scanning of network (in this case, SMB) shares causes a noticeable lag.
&amp;nbsp;I'd rather have a slower scan that doesn't bring down the system than
to have a faster scan that doesn't share the CPU well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to say it, but the box itself is almost as ugly as some of the UI
components. &amp;nbsp;I don't think it's attractive at all. &amp;nbsp;Instead of rounding
corners, I simply have one sliced off. &amp;nbsp;The appearance is awkward at
best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="overall"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing's saving grace is all of the codecs and external media
features. &amp;nbsp;Overall, I'd give it a 3.75/5 stars. &amp;nbsp;The interface gets a
2/5 for sucking so bad, and the feature set gets a 5/5 for being so rich
and complete. &amp;nbsp;I would recommend this unit for those who are more tech
savvy, have more advanced needs, or are simply patient and are willing
to wait for these things to be fixed via updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just this past week, I've managed to really live up my last bits of
2011. &amp;nbsp;During the last week of December, I went to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://longwoodgardens.org"&gt;Longwood
Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to check out their night time
light display. &amp;nbsp;It was worth dealing with the cold (it got down to 26F
that night) to see their winter time display. &amp;nbsp;The last time I was at
Longwood was during the day. &amp;nbsp;There were some parts that I liked better
in the daylight, but the night time was still really impressive. &amp;nbsp;To be
honest, I think Longwood is much more worth visiting at night. &amp;nbsp;One of
the best parts was a fountain display near the entrance into the
gardens. &amp;nbsp;All of the water jets had lights under them that would change
color as the music played on. &amp;nbsp;The jets alone made for an interesting
show, but the lights definitely made it much more captivating. &amp;nbsp;That
alone was worth dealing with the night time cold. &amp;nbsp;To help beat the
cold, I spend some time hiding in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.longwoodgardens.org/TheCafe.html"&gt;the
Cafe&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was a little
bit expensive, but the food was good and they had beer (how could you go
wrong?!). &amp;nbsp;Though it has a very cafeteria look, the food was definitely
not cafeteria quality. &amp;nbsp;I'm kind of sorry that I didn't find that
sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll skip over the part about the New Year's Eve party and leave that
for the people who are on my Facebook :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Year's Day was really special this year. &amp;nbsp;I've lived in Philadelphia
for most of my life, but I had never seen the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummers_Parade"&gt;Mummers
Parade&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Well, that
changed. &amp;nbsp;I spent a few hours of this year hanging out on Broad Street
and watching the show. &amp;nbsp;I don't think I've ever been this fascinated
with costumes before -- there's just something about watching a bunch of
men dressed like women march around while playing the banjo! &amp;nbsp;Today was
a perfect day for it -- it was in the high 4o's/low 50's, sunny, and
relatively calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that 2011's over, I have a lot to look forward to in 2012. &amp;nbsp;For
starters, I've been asked to resume my work on 0 A.D.'s website. &amp;nbsp;I've
also started work on finding a way to use 0 A.D. in computer science
education for high schoolers (more on that later). &amp;nbsp;The big change this
year is the new job, but I'll leave that for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 2012!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I recently sold a bunch of stuff on eBay (as I &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2011/09/26/selling-stuff-on-ebay/"&gt;previously
mentioned&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;I then used that
money to buy a new server. &amp;nbsp;For the sake of making this article easier
to find, here's what I bought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rackable Systems C2004 with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel S5000PSL mother board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 x 2.66 dual core Xeon processors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was to load up this server with RAM (it'll take 32Gb) and hard
drives (4 x 2Tb SATA II) so that I could replace all of my other
servers. &amp;nbsp;This machine has plenty of horse power for performing my GIS
work and for reducing my server count via virtualization. &amp;nbsp;So, like I do
with all servers, I went to install Ubuntu Linux. &amp;nbsp;This is where the fun
ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="trying-to-set-up-the-server"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to Set-up the Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will spare you some of the details, but I ended up trying to install
Ubuntu via a USB thumb drive and a good 'ol IDE CD-ROM drive. &amp;nbsp;Every
time I ran the installer (for 10.04.3 and 11.04), the install worked.
&amp;nbsp;Everything appeared to be set up without a hitch Great, wonderful,
weee! &amp;nbsp;And then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="good-luck-booting-bro"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Luck Booting, Bro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't boot. &amp;nbsp;No matter how I did my install, with or without LVM,
with or without EXT4, with or without&amp;nbsp;sacrificing&amp;nbsp;goats, it just
wouldn't boot. &amp;nbsp;I would just get a black screen with nothing more than a
single blinking cursor. &amp;nbsp;It wouldn't respond to keyboard input, yelling,
or ritualistic dances. &amp;nbsp; Booting the install media in rescue mode showed
that the logs were empty. &amp;nbsp;Clearly, I have a hardware problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I started monkeying around with BIOS settings. &amp;nbsp;I made sure
my on-board (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto"&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt;)
RAID was disabled, that all of the settings were reasonable, and that I
didn't have anything strange turned on. &amp;nbsp;No dice. &amp;nbsp;After days of
troubleshooting, I started hitting the forums. &amp;nbsp;One suggested that if I
don't get a GRUB screen at all that it was a GRUB problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fixing-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that I was using GRUB2. &amp;nbsp;For some reason, it just didn't
play nice with my mobo. &amp;nbsp;So, I booted into rescue mode and executed a
shell in my root partition and ran this (Because I was in a rescue
terminal, I was already root. &amp;nbsp;If you're not root, you must prefix these
with sudo):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;apt-get remove grub-pc&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;apt-get install grub&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;grub-install /dev/sda&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;update-grub&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic! &amp;nbsp;It booted! &amp;nbsp;Hopefully this saves someone a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been working as an actor at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.easternstate.org/"&gt;Eastern State
Penitentiary&lt;/a&gt;'s &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.easternstate.org/halloween"&gt;Terror Behind the
Walls&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; attraction. It's a
lot of work going from a full-time job during the day then down to ESP
at night, but it's been worth it. Acting has been a ton of fun!
Unfortunately, this means some of my projects have slipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the haunt is over (we go back to weekend shows after October), I'll
be resuming my work. Looking at my list of blog posts reminds me that I
have a lot to do and write about. I've been making some good progress on
my GIS work, but I have other things to pick up. I also want to work on
some 0AD stuff, resume work on my on-line D&amp;amp;D character sheet app, and I
have another project that I'm not willing to talk about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully coming back to some of my projects after the haunt will give
me some new ideas or motivation. &amp;nbsp;I've lacked quite a bit of coding
motivation for the last several months (probably because I code all day
at work), so I'm hoping this little break will kick-start things for me
and help me get excited to get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

old tech stuff that I have been holding onto for quite some time. &amp;nbsp;The
majority of it was still in good working order, which is why I was so
hesitant to let it go. &amp;nbsp;Instead of throwing it all away or keeping it in
my closet, I decided to&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://myworld.ebay.com/bstempi"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; a
bunch of it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it's been quite the pleasant experience. &amp;nbsp;I've sold an item
on eBay before, but this was my first time selling a ton of crap.
&amp;nbsp;Posting the items was easy once I had taken a few pictures. &amp;nbsp;Getting
messages and notifications was easy using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mobile.ebay.com/android/ebay-on-android"&gt;eBay Android
app&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Shipping was
easy because most of my items were small, so I just defaulted to using
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.usps.com/"&gt;USPS&lt;/a&gt; flat rate boxes (especially since
the boxes were free!). &amp;nbsp;The USPS allows you to print out your own labels
and to save a few cents (which add up) for not making them do it in
their retail locations. &amp;nbsp;Once I had everything packed and labeled, I
just had to walk it down to the Post Office, which is all of 5 minutes
away, drop it off, and use my eBay app to mark the items as shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got the hang of the process, it became pretty fun. &amp;nbsp;There are
some other things I'm trying to get rid of, so I'll be selling for a
while. &amp;nbsp;eBay even gave me a gold star!&lt;/p&gt;

wants to be able to do some cool things with videos, images, music, and
more. Games are all about media, and any good game website has to do a
good job at showcasing their media. After all, what good is the website
if it doesn't good a good job at showcasing the game (not the one you
just lost, either)? One of the first major customization that I wanted
to make for their new website was to handle videos in a way that allowed
for them to be showcased and to do so with minimal maintenance. We're
all volunteers, so we need to take maintenance effort seriously. I
decided to experiment with writing a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; plugin that
would handle their video management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="youtube-api"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YouTube API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, I thought that I would leverage something that we
already use: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/play0ad"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. We have a
channel, and YT had the ability to organize videos into channels and to
add tagging, ratings, comments, etc. Why not leverage those and find a
way to consume them on our website? After doing a little bit of
Google'ing, I found that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.gdata.youtube.html"&gt;Zend produces a YouTube API for
PHP&lt;/a&gt;.
Awesome! That takes a lot of the guess work out of understanding how to
form URLs, parse arguments, and all of the nasty string stuff that comes
along with calling a web API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the API was really easy. It only took a few lines of code to get
the API to work with my test app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
require_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Gdata_YouTube'); $yt = new Zend_Gdata_YouTube(); $yt-&amp;gt;setMajorProtocolVersion(2);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, getting a feed from a user is really easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$videoFeed = $yt-&amp;gt;getUserUploads('play0ad');
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looping through the results and printing the result of the feed is
slightly more code, but still not tough by any means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
function printVideoFeed($videoFeed) {

    foreach ($videoFeed as $videoEntry) {
        // the videoEntry object contains many helper functions
        // that access the underlying mediaGroup object
        echo 'Video: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoTitle() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Video ID: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoId() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Updated: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getUpdated() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Description: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoDescription() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Category: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoCategory() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Tags: ' . implode(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;, $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoTags()) . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Watch page: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoWatchPageUrl() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Flash Player Url: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getFlashPlayerUrl() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Duration: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoDuration() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'View count: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoViewCount() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Rating: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoRatingInfo() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Geo Location: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoGeoLocation() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Recorded on: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoRecorded() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;

        // see the paragraph above this function for more information on the
        // 'mediaGroup' object. in the following code, we use the mediaGroup
        // object directly to retrieve its 'Mobile RSTP link' child
        foreach ($videoEntry-&amp;gt;mediaGroup-&amp;gt;content as $content) {
            if ($content-&amp;gt;type === &amp;quot;video/3gpp&amp;quot;) {
                echo 'Mobile RTSP link: ' . $content-&amp;gt;url . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
            }
        }

        echo &amp;quot;Thumbnails:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        $videoThumbnails = $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoThumbnails();

        foreach($videoThumbnails as $videoThumbnail) {
            echo $videoThumbnail['time'] . ' - ' . $videoThumbnail['url'];
            echo ' height=' . $videoThumbnail['height'];
            echo ' width=' . $videoThumbnail['width'] . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
            echo '&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;' . $videoThumbnail['url'] .'&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;';
            echo '&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;';
        }
        echo '&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;';
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll have to excuse the poor code formatting...I couldn't get it to
look nice in WP. &amp;nbsp;Oh well. &amp;nbsp;Anyways, that's a lot of power with only a
little bit of code! &amp;nbsp;You can also pull user comments, ratings, and just
about anything else you could find right on YT. &amp;nbsp;Just imagine what I
could do with a plug-in. &amp;nbsp;I could allow a &amp;quot;media manager&amp;quot; to specially
tag videos for front page display or with special tags of some sort that
dictate which pages those videos display on within the WFG site. &amp;nbsp;The
way those tags are interpreted could be handled within WP through an
admin plug-in configuration panel. &amp;nbsp;Someone could choose where a certain
&amp;quot;class&amp;quot; of video (video found on a certain channel, perhaps with a
certain tag) would be displayed by embedding a special tag within the
target page. &amp;nbsp;We could do a lot with a little!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="doing-more"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFG also wants user videos. &amp;nbsp;Our users are our supporters and our
motivation. &amp;nbsp;While searching around, I found a Google App Engine app
called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/direct"&gt;YouTube Direct&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The idea is
that a website can embed a snippet of code on their page to&amp;nbsp;elicit
videos for a contest. &amp;nbsp;Each such portal would be associated with a
contest. &amp;nbsp;When a user clicks on that entry bit, they will be prompted to
log into YouTube and to either select a current video or to upload a new
one. &amp;nbsp;Once a video is identified or uploaded, it will be added to a
queue for contest admins to look at. &amp;nbsp;Note that the video lives on the
user's account and that they still own it...the video itself doesn't
actually sit in a queue. &amp;nbsp;Admins can accept or reject videos, leave
comments and ratings, and a few other things that would reside within
the app. &amp;nbsp;Once videos are accepted, they're added to a channel on the
host account (the one running the contests) for all to see. &amp;nbsp;Once again,
this is key because it's pretty low maintenance, utilizes free resources
or resources that we already have, and adds a lot of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm pretty impressed with what I can do with a few lines of
code and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/bstempi/0ad-youtube-channel-for-wordpress/wiki/Home"&gt;started my plugin
development&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;I've been adding code as I've been able to. &amp;nbsp;It's slow, but moving. &amp;nbsp;I
get to add code once per week or every other week, which is slower than
I'd like, but at least I'm moving along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

minivans and Ford Foci collide in August of this year. &amp;nbsp;My car got
nailed (read: totaled), so I got thrown into the market for a new car.
&amp;nbsp;The Focus had always served me well (I've owned two of them), so I
naturally went back to Ford for a third. &amp;nbsp;I had the same constraints
that were in place when I purchased my first two cars: &amp;nbsp;it had to be
reasonably cheap (&amp;lt;$20k), get good gas mileage (&amp;gt;30 MPG), and have a
stick shift. &amp;nbsp;Generally, the last requirement is a pain...Ford seems to
think that I only want a stick shift if I want a car with the
bare-minimum in accessories, or that I want one that has all of them.
&amp;nbsp;It's a bit of a pain to find a Focus that is decently equipped and has
a stick. &amp;nbsp;Remembering my pain, I was open to looking at other vehicles.
&amp;nbsp;As you'd expect, the dealership that I initially went to took that and
ran with it by introducing me to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fiesta"&gt;Ford
Fiesta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't purchase a car from that dealership, but I did end up
purchasing a&amp;nbsp;metallic&amp;nbsp;lime sedan model from C and C Ford in Horsham
(never again, btw -- would not recommend). &amp;nbsp;Here's my experience so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="appearance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car looks pretty awesome! &amp;nbsp;Some positive bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The color is awesome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting in the front makes you feel like you're in a cockpit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The red glow of the buttons in the dark looks pretty slick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The body has a pretty unique shape. &amp;nbsp;One friend described it as a
'bullet'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None. &amp;nbsp;I have yet to find anything about the car that is
aesthetically unpleasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ride/Feel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I'm pretty satisfied here. &amp;nbsp;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The clutch has a much tighter feeling than my 2007 Ford Focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stick has a nice &amp;quot;click&amp;quot; into each speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The engine has a nice hum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seat hugs me nicely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only have 120-ish HP. &amp;nbsp;Hills and acceleration (when above 40 MPH)
sucks. &amp;nbsp;My friend had trouble merging my car into highway traffic
because he wasn't anticipating the lack of power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse is a pain. &amp;nbsp;For some reason, it's always a pain to get into
reverse without grinding or having the false feeling of being
in-gear. &amp;nbsp;It's fairly annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="entertainment-sytem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entertainment Sytem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first vehicle with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Sync"&gt;MS
Sync&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;At first I was pretty
impressed, but that kind of faded away. &amp;nbsp;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in USB port (VERY NICE!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth audio streaming (VERY NICE!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth phone tethering (for voice and data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mic for the driver is mounted above their head and sounds very
nice. &amp;nbsp;No one knew that I was driving when I was talking to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-dash keypad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steering wheel mounted media controller (change inputs and switch
tracks where applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decent sound system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice control (pretty impressive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My car decided that it no longer wanted to pair with my phone. &amp;nbsp;Car
forums suggest that a hard reset or that disconnecting the batter is
the best fix. &amp;nbsp;Eww, Ford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound system lacks on the lower end at any volume above 12 or 13
(the stereo goes up to 30)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The volume dial lies (see the next paragraph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching songs is slow when using a USB/Bluetooth device as input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I hit the &amp;quot;voice command&amp;quot; button, there's a 1 in 20 chance that
the music will stop, but the unit will not prompt me for input and
will not accept voice commands until I power cycle the unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, I thought that I should take some time to elaborate on
the pros and cons here. &amp;nbsp;I was pretty blown away by Sync at first. &amp;nbsp;Once
it indexed my iPod Touch, it worked really well. &amp;nbsp;It blew me away! &amp;nbsp;Then
I started noticing flaws. &amp;nbsp;For whatever reason, switching tracks was
taking forever. &amp;nbsp;My in-dash CD player was switching tracks 2-4 times
faster than the MP3 player (note: &amp;nbsp;this might be an iPod interface
problem). &amp;nbsp;Then, my phone stopped pairing with my car. &amp;nbsp;My roommate's
phone was also paired, and we were able to confirm that it wasn't just
my phone...it didn't like anybody's phone! &amp;nbsp;Lastly, I cited complaints
about the sound. &amp;nbsp;I have the 'upgraded' sound system. &amp;nbsp;It's ok, but I
can't imagine what the stock system must be like! &amp;nbsp;The low end fades
away pretty quickly, which stinks. &amp;nbsp;Also, the car's volume doesn't
actually go to 30 as I noted in the bullet list. &amp;nbsp;It stops getting
louder after 18. &amp;nbsp;I'm pretty sure that the sound quality in my Focus was
on-par with the Fiesta *and* was louder. &amp;nbsp;So much for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've really come to love my car. &amp;nbsp;The vehicle is an awesome piece of
machinery -- I definitely made the right purchase. &amp;nbsp;However, I have a
few negative things to express as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I experienced a pretty scary moment while driving
one day. &amp;nbsp;While driving through Temple University's campus, I attempted
to hit my&amp;nbsp;accelerator while leaving a stop sign. &amp;nbsp;I was surprised by an
obstruction. &amp;nbsp;I managed to limp the car to the curb and to reach down to
find out what was stuck on my pedal. &amp;nbsp;It turned out to be a piece of air
duct. &amp;nbsp;This could have been really scary if it had fallen under my break
pedal (I'm sure you can imagine). &amp;nbsp;I haven't had time to do so, but when
I finally get it repaired, I intend on reporting this to Ford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I was delivered a car that had window switches that didn't work.
&amp;nbsp;From the driver's panel, I'm able to put down my back driver's side
window, but unable to put it back up. &amp;nbsp;I have to reach back to that door
and use its switch to put it up. &amp;nbsp;It's a minor inconvenience, but I
think it was easily preventable. &amp;nbsp;The dealership spent time detailing
the car before delivering it to me, so why not test some of the basic
functions? &amp;nbsp;I'm sure I'll complain more once I have to actually take the
time to get it fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think it's a great car. &amp;nbsp;If I had to do it all over again,
I'd buy the same car (though from someone else -- I blame the dealership
for some of my issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

recently received an email that furnished me with my account credentials
and details. &amp;nbsp;I couldn't wait to play around, so I immediately dropped
what I was doing and hopped right in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm pretty impressed. &amp;nbsp;I decided to allocate all of my disk and
RAM resources to a single VM instance, so I currently have a machine in
the cloud running &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ubuntu.com"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; 10.04 LTS with 512MB
of ram and a 16GB disk. &amp;nbsp;The first thing to note is that having a
machine imaged takes almost no time at all. &amp;nbsp;I selected the OS,
allocated the resources, and I had a machine in &amp;lt; 5 minutes. &amp;nbsp;I was then
impressed again with the speed of the machine. &amp;nbsp;Once I was able to SSH
in, I installed some packages (PHP, PostgreSQL, Tomcat, Apache, and a
few others). &amp;nbsp;The instance was very snappy and responsive through the
install process. &amp;nbsp;Last, but not least, the web interface for managing my
Linode account is pretty awesome. &amp;nbsp;The interface is very nicely laid
out, very responsive, and generally awe inspiring (I wish I could make
interfaces that nice). &amp;nbsp;They even provide an AJAX terminal into your
instance should you be locked out for some reason!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to spend a little more time playing around with my new toy.
&amp;nbsp;I need a place to host
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages"&gt;JSP&lt;/a&gt; applications for
my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bdpaphilly.org/"&gt;BDPA students&lt;/a&gt;, so I might be interested
in keeping this instance once my free trial expires. &amp;nbsp;We'll see how it
handles once I start placing a regular load on it.&lt;/p&gt;

doing some digging, I realized that I didn't have much to show. &amp;nbsp;Most of
the cool stuff that I wrote was proprietary, so I couldn't just expose
it. &amp;nbsp;The stuff that I've written for myself has been very hackish and
incomplete. &amp;nbsp;Some of the stuff was written as a mod to other PHP
scripts, so the code was out-of-context. &amp;nbsp;So, here I sit with my
tactical pants around my ankles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make sure that this sort of thing doesn't happen again, I've
started a public code repo for people to look at. &amp;nbsp;In this code repo, I
solve programming problems from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://projecteuler.net"&gt;Project
Euler&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If you use Mecurial, you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/bstempi/projecteuler"&gt;check
out the code directly&lt;/a&gt; or
go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/bstempi/projecteuler/overview"&gt;my BitBucket
page&lt;/a&gt; and get a
zipped version. &amp;nbsp;Currently, the language of choice, as stated, is PHP.
&amp;nbsp;I might add other languages as time progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the repo is pretty empty. &amp;nbsp;My intention is to write
a small framework that will allow you to write self-contained solutions
for each of the problems presented on Project Euler. &amp;nbsp;From there, the
framework will allow a user to call the problem by CLI or web interface.
&amp;nbsp;The framework will be responsible for gathering and passing along user
input and for loading the appropriate PHP files to solve the problem.
&amp;nbsp;Each solution will be responsible for implementing a small interface,
validating it's own input, and providing all of it's own methods. &amp;nbsp;As
problems accumulate, I'll probably move some of the mathematical and
validation functions from each of the solutions into some sort of shared
static library in order to reduce the amount of work in solving each
additional problem and to reduce my code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that this is a little nerve racking; I'm not used to others
reviewing my code. &amp;nbsp;As always, feedback is welcome (probably a little
more than usual). &amp;nbsp;Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

Lefkovitz&lt;/a&gt; asked me to help him
diagnose a problem with a web app.&amp;nbsp; The issue involved the communication
between a browser and an AJAX web service used for authentication.&amp;nbsp; The
initial struggle was trying to find an easy and elegant way of viewing
the AJAX request and response.&amp;nbsp; The answer was simple:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://getfirebug.com/"&gt;Firebug&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue! &amp;nbsp;After seeing
Firebug in action, I was asked to prepare a short lecture and
demonstration of Firebug so that my classmates can benefit from this
tool. &amp;nbsp;My notes and demo follow below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-need"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every rookie web dev shares the same initial thought:&amp;nbsp; web apps are
impossible to debug!&amp;nbsp; There's always several languages involved (some
server side language, HTML, and possibly some CSS, JavaScript and
SQL).&amp;nbsp; Diagnosing problems with compiled code is hard enough...how do
we diagnose problems when those programs present HTML instead of
direct screen output?&amp;nbsp; How do we diagnose problems with the output
itself (like HTML and JavaScript errors)?&amp;nbsp; Where the hell is
System.out.println()?&amp;nbsp; We can't view what's going on inside of the web
browser!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firebug does exactly that:&amp;nbsp; allow you to view what is going on inside of
the browser.&amp;nbsp; You can see how Firefox is interpreting your HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript.&amp;nbsp; You can also see raw HTTP sessions, response times, and
can step though JavaScript code.&amp;nbsp; Finally, a way to see exactly what the
browser sees! Note: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chromium.org/devtools"&gt;Chrome has a
tool&lt;/a&gt; similar to Firebug built in.
&amp;nbsp;Internet Explorer also has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_Developer_Toolbar"&gt;similar
plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-firebug"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Firebug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox has a pretty awesome plug-in engine.&amp;nbsp; To get Firebug, simply
go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.getfirebug.com"&gt;getfirebug.com&lt;/a&gt; and click the
&amp;quot;Install Firebug for Firefox&amp;quot; button in the upper-right hand corner of
the page.&amp;nbsp; Easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-started"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that you have a new icon in the lower-right hand corner
of the Firefox window after restarting the browser.&amp;nbsp; This button
toggles the Firebug display.&amp;nbsp; By clicking on this button, you can
toggle the Firebug view on and off.&amp;nbsp; When you toggle the window on,
you'll get something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Firebug window" src="http://getfirebug.com/wiki/images/7/7d/Console_Panel.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that there are 6 tabs along the top: console, HTML, CSS,
script, DOM, and net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="console"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The console is actually a JavaScrip console. &amp;nbsp;It allows you to execute
JavaScript code and observe errors, both in real time. &amp;nbsp;This means that
you can type lines of JavaScript code right into the console and they'll
execute on-the-spot. &amp;nbsp;I personally don't use this feature too much, but
I'm sure others do. &amp;nbsp;It's worth noting here that when you click on the
Console tab for the first time it will be disabled. &amp;nbsp;Several of the tabs
are disabled by default when you start Firebug. &amp;nbsp;This is because of
performance reasons -- there's no sense in starting up every single tab
(some of which can be a burden to the system) if you just want to debug
some HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="html"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel allows you to see how your HTML is being interpreted by
FF.&amp;nbsp; It also allows you to see the 'current' HTML.&amp;nbsp; That means that if
you write some JavaScript code that modifies the page, this view will
reflect those changes. &amp;nbsp;You can also modify HTML through this console.
This panel also has a tool that allows you to visually select an
element and then takes you to the appropriate place in the code.
Conversely, if you float your mouse over a bit of HTML code, the
element within the HTML page will be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="css"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the HTML panel, this view allows you to see how your CSS
rules are interpreted and applied.&amp;nbsp; You can turn off individual rules,
add rules, or modify rules on-the-fly.&amp;nbsp; You can even see which rules
supersede other rules and which rules are superseded.&amp;nbsp; This is really
useful for testing changes in CSS without having to go through the
write-save-reload-view process.&amp;nbsp; You can change the CSS within the
browser and view the changes without having to constantly switch
windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="script"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is the most mystical and magical thing that you'll see
today if you have ever had to do any sort of JavaScript debugging
prior to knowing about Firebug.&amp;nbsp; Firebug will allow you all of the
same debugging features for JavaScript that Netbeans would give you
for Java.&amp;nbsp; You can step through lines of code, set up break points,
and view variable values during execution.&amp;nbsp; It'll even show you the
stack, which is useful for trying to figure out which anonymous
functions you're buried in. &amp;nbsp;Syntax and interpretation errors are also
caught easily using this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dom"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DOM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOM explorer allows you to navigate the DOM and to view each
object's properties.&amp;nbsp; This is helpful when doing JavaScript debugging
and design. &amp;nbsp;Unlike the HTML view, the DOM view will show you the
JavaScript properties for objects or elements that you're interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="net"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Net&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel allows you to see network traffic from a high level.&amp;nbsp; It
will show each HTTP(S) request that the browser makes, the time it
took for the server to respond, the length and time of the response,
it's content, etc etc.&amp;nbsp; This is really useful for trying to track down
latency problems or to view AJAX or web service communications. &amp;nbsp;It
also allows you to benchmark your web sites performance (eg, is the
page loading slow due to a slow server response, or the browser
choking on JavaScript code?). &amp;nbsp;This view provides sub-tabs that allow
you to drill down to view only certain types of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="exercise"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help show off some of Firebug's features, I decided to
make up an
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianstempin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/firebugExample.html.zip"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;
to show some of the potential uses. &amp;nbsp;Some of the exercises are in text,
while others will be verbally stated. &amp;nbsp;This file probably won't make too
much sense unless you're in class to see the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ze-end"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ze End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to leave comments or to ask questions!&lt;/p&gt;

work. &amp;nbsp;I've spent some time in the community and a lot of time using,
hacking, and theming WordPress. &amp;nbsp;As I've stated before in other posts,
this site is powered by WordPress. &amp;nbsp;Being so involved with WP, I decided
to pay attention to an important &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/07/22/1935248/WordPress-Creator-GPL-Says-WP-Template-Must-Be-GPLd"&gt;debate that I saw roll across
Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;nbsp;Should all WP themes and plugins be
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"&gt;GLP&lt;/a&gt;'d?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the GPL's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license"&gt;viral&lt;/a&gt;...I get that.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ma.tt"&gt;The Fearless Leader of Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; argues that themes
can't run without WordPress, therefore they are derivative works.
&amp;nbsp;Others argue otherwise. &amp;nbsp;So the fundamental questions are, &amp;quot;What is a
derivative work?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Is a WordPress theme a derivative work?&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;On the
first question, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html"&gt;GPL
v2&lt;/a&gt; (the license that WP
uses) has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.&lt;/strong&gt; This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
&amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &amp;quot;work
based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the Program or any derivative
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.) Each
licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're theme contains a portion of WP, then it must be GPL'd. &amp;nbsp;So,
what constitutes &amp;quot;a portion?&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;All WP themes contain API calls -- does
this mean that it's a derivative work? &amp;nbsp;Several people argue both ways,
but I'm going to choose a side here: &amp;nbsp;merely using public API calls does
not make your work a derivative. &amp;nbsp;Why not? &amp;nbsp;Well, look at the definition
of &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; in the quote above. &amp;nbsp;No modifications are
actually taking place. &amp;nbsp;In the case of a theme, I can look at the first
line in the second paragraph (&amp;quot;Activities other than...&amp;quot;). &amp;nbsp;If your
theme does not contain a copy, is not distributed with, and does not
modify WordPress (in the source code sense), then the license doesn't
apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Here's a few different examples that I came up with:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Let's pretend that I'm a developer writing a program for Linux. &amp;nbsp;I
want to write a program that does &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; and logs it's actions. &amp;nbsp;When
logging those actions, I use some sort of system call to get the time.
&amp;nbsp;That library that returns the time might be a GPL'd library (GPL, not
LGPL). &amp;nbsp;Does this mean that I'd have to release the source code to my
program because I use a GPL'd system call? &amp;nbsp;Of course not! &amp;nbsp;If this
were true, then it would be really, *really* hard to write closed
source programs that run on Linux. &amp;nbsp;Clearly, this is not the case.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's fun one. &amp;nbsp; Matt Mullenweg made this argument &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-matt-mullenweg/"&gt;during a verbal
exchange&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think just one way to test it is, you know, take a screenshot of a
website running WordPress without Thesis and then take a screenshot
of a website running Thesis without WordPress.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to get into specifics with Thesis. &amp;nbsp;Let's, for the sake of
argument, substitute &amp;quot;Thesis&amp;quot; with any theme in the world. &amp;nbsp;Here, Matt
is appealing to a common-sense definition of a &amp;quot;derivative work.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;It
makes sense and is a very convincing argument. &amp;nbsp;I, however, reject this
argument because the GPL (poorly) defines &amp;quot;derivative work.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;If I
didn't touch your source, it's not derivative. &amp;nbsp;Sure, my theme might be
designed for WP, but that's not a derivative as per the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt's argument also appeals to the idea of respecting the Open Source
Community: &amp;nbsp;if I release a theme under a commercial license, am I some
how ripping off the individuals that contributed code to the project?
&amp;nbsp;My answer to this is no. &amp;nbsp;One of the ways that Matt (his company,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://automattic.com/"&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt;) makes money is by performing
spam filtering for WP blogs. &amp;nbsp;It's called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://akismet.com/"&gt;Askimet&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In fact, he mentions this during the
verbal exchange that I linked to earlier in this post. &amp;nbsp;The Askimet
plugin for WP, presumably GPL (I didn't go check), provides access to
Askimet's spam filtering service. &amp;nbsp;Ok, cool -- the plugin is GPL
(presumably), but the service isn't open-source. &amp;nbsp;I can't go grab the
Askimet service's source code and host my own spam filtering. &amp;nbsp;So what?
&amp;nbsp;Well, if I wrote a plugin that preformed the spam filtering WP-Side (on
the host that is actually running WP), Matt would (presumably) argue
that this rips off the community and is a violation of the GPL.
&amp;nbsp;Clearly, he's ok with moving the functionality elsewhere and then
charging for it. &amp;nbsp;Really, he's only GPL'd the interface between WP and
Askimet. &amp;nbsp;Is this really open-source? &amp;nbsp;Is this ripping off the open
source community any more or less than a closed-source plugin that
performs this same function WP-side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think so. &amp;nbsp;What's the difference? &amp;nbsp;In both cases, you're
preventing the user from tweaking the functionality (at least to some
degree) of the service. &amp;nbsp;The Askimet plugin might as well be
closed-source -- most of the magic happens behind curtains that I can't
see through. &amp;nbsp;In the end, the net effect is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, who can get mad at someone adding value to WP though
closed-source means? &amp;nbsp;Sure, it'd be more beneficial to the community if
all plugins, themes, etc were OSS, but closed-source software can still
add value, too. &amp;nbsp;As long as no code is stolen from WP, they shouldn't
care. &amp;nbsp;Closed source is not the devil. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I don't understand the
WP community enough to really talk too much about the &amp;quot;rip off&amp;quot; factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know -- this doesn't directly effect me at the moment, but this
issue still makes me a bit upset. &amp;nbsp;It's frustrating that some people try
to make the GPL infinitely viral. &amp;nbsp;I love open source software, but I
think that forcing me to open-source any themes that I create is taking
it too far. &amp;nbsp;I work on an open source project (GPL v2), and I can't say
that I'd get upset at someone developing a closed-source add-on and
making money off of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;nbsp;Service&lt;/a&gt;
effort. &amp;nbsp;My friend &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://timjhenry.com"&gt;Tim Henry&lt;/a&gt; thought that the
machine would die from a heat stroke. &amp;nbsp;This model is known for blowing
its power supplies and for leaking capacitors. &amp;nbsp;I thought it would hold
up, so I decided to make a bet out of it. &amp;nbsp;If it lasted a year, then Tim
would have to buy 2 tickets to a heavy metal concert and take me. &amp;nbsp;If
the machine failed within a year, I'd have to purchase the tickets. &amp;nbsp;The
bet was on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased the machine sometime in September, so the machine had to
last until 1SEP2010. &amp;nbsp;I had a scare when the CPU fan died a few days ago
-- &amp;nbsp;I thought this might put me out of the race. &amp;nbsp;After replacing it,
Tim said that this did not constitute losing -- only a dead processor,
dead power supply, or malfunctioning capacitor qualified. &amp;nbsp;This was
great -- I was still in the running!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...until I noticed something. &amp;nbsp;After replacing the CPU fan, I noticed
that the power supply fan was not turning. &amp;nbsp;After getting very hot, the
fan finally loosened up and started turning. &amp;nbsp;This is how I left the
machine this past Saturday. &amp;nbsp;It's now the Wednesday after and my machine
appears to have turned itself off. &amp;nbsp;The power light on the front was
flashing orange. &amp;nbsp;I'm guessing that there was a 'heat event,' so the
machine shut itself down. &amp;nbsp;My power supply's good, but the machine won't
run for multiple days in a row. &amp;nbsp;Go figure that it dies with 5 or 6
weeks of winning the bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, I must admit defeat. &amp;nbsp;I'll get you Mr. Henry!

the course's website. &amp;nbsp;While thinking the other day, it occurred to me
that I have yet to write about my experience using Moodle, which powers
that website. &amp;nbsp;Since its such an awesome piece of OSS, I figured that it
was worth some space in my blog. &amp;nbsp;Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line up front: &amp;nbsp;I like Moodle. &amp;nbsp;I think it can stand to improve,
but I think it's pretty far ahead of Blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-to-like"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's to Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do I start? &amp;nbsp;I spend most of my time teaching courses, so I
guess I'll start talking about what an instructor sees. &amp;nbsp;The first
really cool thing is the topic outline -- you can choose how many
topics/weeks are in your course and prepopulate them. &amp;nbsp;You can hide
and reveal them as you see fit, which makes it easy to recycle
material from course to course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons are pretty cool little bits -- within a lesson, you can make
a sort of blog post. &amp;nbsp;You can then attach several objects to that blog
post, such as a quiz, assignment, document, poll, and so on. &amp;nbsp;The tools
to add these items to your lesson are pretty easy and intuitive. &amp;nbsp;You
can even add wikis and forums&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;forums&amp;quot; (Moodle-speak for message boards) are pretty neat, too.
&amp;nbsp;The front page by default is a message board. &amp;nbsp;So, what makes it more
like a message board than a blog post? &amp;nbsp;For one, you can have the post
emailed out to everyone that's subscribed to that forum. &amp;nbsp;By default,
all registered users are enrolled to the front page and each student is
enrolled to the News Forum within each course that they're taking.
&amp;nbsp;There's even an &amp;quot;oops&amp;quot; feature. &amp;nbsp;By default, the forum will wait for 30
minutes before mailing out your post, which gives you a chance to fix
anything that you might have slipped by you until after clicking the
&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot; button. &amp;nbsp;The recipients of this email get a neatly formatted
HTML message that gives them a copy of the post. &amp;nbsp;The user can then
reply directly to the poster via email or on the forum. &amp;nbsp;Unlike (some)
blog posts, these forums support threading -- they can easily carry
multiple questions or discussions per post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiz feature quickly became one of my favorite. &amp;nbsp;Each course has a
pool of questions. &amp;nbsp;These questions could be multiple choice (with
multiple answers or partial credit), true/false, free-response,
matching, calculated (like a math or physics problem), and a few other
types. &amp;nbsp;For the numeric, calculated, multiple choice, and true/false,
the quizzes auto-grade themselves. &amp;nbsp;They can even leave specific
feedback for students based on their answer. &amp;nbsp;You can give them multiple
attempts, each one resulting in a different amount of partial credit.
&amp;nbsp;When giving the quiz, Moodle can even time the student and mix up the
questions for you, helping to cut down on cheating. &amp;nbsp;The free response
question types are pretty cool, too. &amp;nbsp;An instructor gets to leave some
piece of feedback (which is displayed on the student's grade report)
along with the grade. &amp;nbsp;You can delegate grading to another instructor
(such as a TA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assignments are the last of my favorite features. &amp;nbsp;Some of my
assignments require students to write free responses or to create HTML
or Java files. &amp;nbsp;The assignments activity (these objects are all called
activities in Moodle-speak) allows me to easily receive text or files
from a student. &amp;nbsp;I can do things like set hard or soft limits on the due
dates. &amp;nbsp;Once I've received the assignment, I can grade it, leave
feedback, select a grade, and have Moodle notify the student. &amp;nbsp;Slick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-to-hate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's to Hate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what I hate lives on the administrative back end. &amp;nbsp;The
biggest of these is the plugin system. &amp;nbsp;CMSs like WordPress and Drupal
allow you to upload packages that it can unzip and install. You can't
do that with Moodle yet -- you have to unzip your own packages and
carefully place each component in the appropriate folder. &amp;nbsp;What a
pain! &amp;nbsp;You need SSH or FTP access to the server to add any
functionality. &amp;nbsp;I hope this changes soon -- this really puts me off.
&amp;nbsp;There are so many good plugins that I'm&amp;nbsp;hesitant&amp;nbsp;to install, such as
Facebook integration, tag cloud generators, and many others. &amp;nbsp;I'd
rather wait for an improvement in the plugin system rather than
attempt an iffy operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default roles that exist work well, but I would like to see some
others. &amp;nbsp;I and many others teach high school kids. &amp;nbsp;It'd be nice if
there were an easy way to link parents and students so that the parent
gets all (or some) of the same notifications that the students gets.
&amp;nbsp;Its a bit of a pain to set things up so that parents can see their
student's grade. &amp;nbsp;I understand that plugins exist to do this type of
thing -- see my first complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes -- there's a bit of a sore point. &amp;nbsp;Moodle comes with a few
default themes. &amp;nbsp;Most of them are pretty&amp;nbsp;horrendous. &amp;nbsp;There are a few
that look nice, but they're not very customizable. &amp;nbsp;Drupal and WordPress
(especially with the 3.0 release) allows themes that offer options to
the user, such as certain colors or the ability to set a header image.
&amp;nbsp;No one wants to go hack some code or have to use (S)FTP to upload a new
header image -- yuck! &amp;nbsp;I'd rather just leave my site with the default
looks than to go through that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Moodle's weaknesses, I still think that Moodle is a great
piece of software. &amp;nbsp;Its fairly (some menus get confusing) easy for an
instructor to use and still manages to maintain its power. &amp;nbsp;Its served
me well this year, and I'm sure it'll continue to serve me well. &amp;nbsp;I
like it more than Blackboard and was happy that it came with most of
the functionality that I wanted. &amp;nbsp;The last thing I wanted to do was
try to use WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla with plugins to provide the
additional functionality -- I want it all in one place and
out-of-the-box. &amp;nbsp;Moodle did that for me. &amp;nbsp;Great job, Moodle devs!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here's a pretty cool thing that I recently saw (did?). &amp;nbsp;Last week, I
traveled down to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cityofmyrtlebeach.com/"&gt;Myrtle Beach&lt;/a&gt;,
South Carolina with a few friends to celebrate their graduation. &amp;nbsp;We
decided that traveling with 5 people in one car was just too much to
tolerate for a 10 hour drive, so we split into two cars. &amp;nbsp;Now: &amp;nbsp;what to
do for 10 hours? &amp;nbsp;Answer: &amp;nbsp;surf the 'net!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Masterson was driving the lead car, which was co-piloted by
Christian Willman. &amp;nbsp;Here's the equipment being used in the lead car:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rob's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(electrical)"&gt;power
inverter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris's Macbook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream"&gt;G1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point"&gt;WAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Chris's G1 has an application called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.junefabrics.com/index.php"&gt;PdaNet&lt;/a&gt; installed. &amp;nbsp;This
software allows him to connect his G1 to his Macbook (via USB) and to
allow the phone to act as a router and DHCP server. &amp;nbsp;Chris then went on
to connect his WAP to his Macbook (via ethernet) and to bridge the
connection. &amp;nbsp;Now, anyone within range of the WAP could connect and get
internet through his phone...kind of like a MiFi on steroids. &amp;nbsp;In the
chase car, piloted by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://timjhenry.com"&gt;Tim Henry&lt;/a&gt;, we were able
to get a decent wireless signal while on the highway. &amp;nbsp;For the majority
of the trip (until we got within an hour or two of Myrtle Beach), we
were able to surf the internet from both vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the internet wasn't reachable, we were still able to keep
ourselves pretty occupied. &amp;nbsp;Tim brought a couple of movies on his
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook"&gt;netbook&lt;/a&gt;, so we sat it on the
dashboard and routed the audio though his car stereo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we can find a way to make anything geeky :-P.&lt;/p&gt;

had time to play with either of them. &amp;nbsp;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to pick up Symfony first. &amp;nbsp;One of the biggest reasons is that
Netbeans has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/symfony-screencast.html"&gt;Symfony
plugin&lt;/a&gt; to
help ease development. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, there is an
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Doctrine/en/"&gt;on-line&lt;/a&gt;
(and print) book that walks a new user through developing a full
application. &amp;nbsp;Symfony has some pretty cool things, like the ability to
use different ORMs, an MVC design pattern, and different environments.
&amp;nbsp;The different environments feature is really neat -- if I'm developing
an application, I can enter the development environment by calling my
app through a different URL. &amp;nbsp;This different URL will still call my app,
but it will also enable logging, disable caching, show me all
exceptions, etc, etc. &amp;nbsp;If I want to see how it acts in production, I can
simply call the same app through a different URL. &amp;nbsp;Pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a few different apps that I've wanted to write for a
while. &amp;nbsp;I'm not too far into the Symfony documentation, but I'm starting
to think that developing some of these apps would be a good exercise.
&amp;nbsp;I'd talk more about my ideas, but I want to be able to flesh them out
before they get stolen :p.&lt;/p&gt;
