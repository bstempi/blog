Well, it's time to fix that. I've done a lot of out-of-band development and side projects since I've last written, but nothing that I've published until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one of my side projects I'm using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi"&gt;Raspberry Pi 3B …&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Holy moly, it's been a while since I've written!

&lt;h1&gt;The Problem&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one of my side projects I'm using a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi#Raspberry_Pi"&gt;Raspberry Pi 3B+&lt;/a&gt; to drive some LEDs. For this particular project, I'm using the &lt;a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dotstar-leds"&gt;DotStar&lt;/a&gt; LEDs. They're connected to my Pi via SPI. I soldered some wires to a test strip and have those connected to the &lt;a href="https://de.pinout.xyz/pinout/spi"&gt;SPI0 pins&lt;/a&gt; via a JST connector that I've plugged in the Pi's header pins. Adafruit produces some pretty &lt;a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DotStar"&gt;easy to use Python drivers&lt;/a&gt;, so programming these LEDs is easy enough. But I want to do more than just set individual LED values. I want to be able to produce and play animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt like I needed to develop a new library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Requirements&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I specifically wanted to be able to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programmatically create animation sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Serialize animation sequences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Play animations, preferably on multiple boards, but primarily on the Pi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy-peasy. I need some data structures, an interface and/or classes for serialization, and an interface and/or classes for rendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sectional-Art/pixelbuf-pi-animation"&gt;implementation on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; and find my &lt;a href="https://pixelbuf-pi-animation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"&gt;documentation on Read The Docs&lt;/a&gt;. As of right now, it's built on top of &lt;a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Pixelbuf"&gt;Adafruit's Pixelbuf library&lt;/a&gt;. Presumably, this library should work with any of their drivers that are built on it. As of this writing, it has only been tested with the &lt;a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_DotStar"&gt;DotStar driver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Examples&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project documentation already covers the specifics, so I figured I'd leave the rest of this blog post for fun examples and some examples of things I've done with this library so far. Here is a link to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sectional-Art/pixelbuf-pi-animation/tree/c37f4905bfef5228321503e9ede083887d83b931/notebooks/examples"&gt;Jupyter Notebooks used as of the time of this writing&lt;/a&gt;. While the contents of that link will never change, please keep in mind that the library may have evolved by time you see this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run the example notebooks, make sure you have all the stuff you need for your particular LED setup, this library, and &lt;code&gt;jupyter&lt;/code&gt;. If you checkout or download the notebooks, you can &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the directory containing the notebooks and run &lt;code&gt;jupyter notebook&lt;/code&gt; in order to start a notebook server. From there, you can run, modify, or create new notebooks and experiments. I find this particularly convenient since my Pi is headless. It gives me an easy way to test and execute code on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test all of this stuff, I've constructed the world's most sophisticated testing rig. It includes some 3d printed feet, a spare DIN rail, a piece of corrugated plastic, and some hot glue. As I'm sure you can tell from the photo, absolutely no mistakes were made and everything is perfectly square and level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Absolutely awful test rig" src="https://brianstempin.com/images/led-testing-rig-300x225.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://brianstempin.com/images/led-testing-rig-original.jpg"&gt;Full resolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Runway Guard Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full writeup of this one can be found in &lt;code&gt;Programatic Generation of Animations.ipynb&lt;/code&gt;. It mimics the lights that are found at the entrance of runways at larger airports. This isn't exactly what the one that I'm thinking of looks like, but it's close. All it's missing is a fade-in-and-out before wig-wagging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The color is a bit washed out in the video, but here's my take on that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuwZl3LMZfo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Christmas Themed Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When putting some of these examples together, it was Thanksgiving weekend. With &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YekZoouZn9E"&gt;Chrimbus&lt;/a&gt; right around the corner, I thought I'd add my own Christmas animation. The way this works is that to start, it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selects a random color from red, green, or white&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selects a random brightness for that color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selects a random direction for that brightness (brighter or dimmer)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each pixel, it will make it brighter or dimmer until it "dies" (is as bright or as dim as it can go). For that pixel, the random process repeats. This generates a random-looking animation that can be looped easily without an obvious-looking loop point. It also has an interesting "twinkle" effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Too Lazy to Write Something for the Rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further commentary, I'll post the rest of the videos I produced. Each video contains a link back to the exact Jupyter Notebook that produced it, allowing you to do the same thing for &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; it and do something else interesting. If you wanna talk about it, &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sectional-Art/pixelbuf-pi-animation/discussions"&gt;contact me here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

I hope not...it sounds like a terrible task...but in case you have, it just so happens I might have an approach your interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;General Approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PySpark does not support Excel directly, but it does support reading in binary data.  So, here's the thought pattern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a bunch of Excel files in as an RDD, one record per file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using some sort of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function, feed each binary blob to Pandas to read, creating an RDD of (file name, tab name, Pandas DF) tuples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optional) if the Pandas data frames are all the same shape, then we can convert them all into Spark data frames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reading in Excel Files as Binary Blobs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is pretty easy:  &lt;a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/api/python/pyspark.html#pyspark.SparkContext.binaryFiles"&gt;SparkContext.binaryFiles()&lt;/a&gt; is your friend here.  If you give it a directory, it'll read each file in the directory as a binary blob and place it into an RDD.  If you have 10 files, you'll get back an RDD with 10 entries, each one containing the file name and it's contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Making Sense of the Binary Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The is the part where we need to take that binary data and turn it into something sensible.  My thought was that Pandas has built-in support for Excel files, so perhaps that'd be a good tool to do a transformation.  Because we're using Spark, we can use a &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; function to work on several of these files in parallel.  Here's a simple example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;functools&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;pd_dfs_from_excel_rdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rdd_record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas_opts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;file_path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rdd_record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;file_contents&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rdd_record&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;file_like_obj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BytesIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;file_contents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;df_dict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_excel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;file_like_obj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas_opts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;dfs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sheet_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sheet_df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;file_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sheet_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sheet_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;dfs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;entry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dfs&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;spark_context&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Start your context here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;excel_files_rdd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;spark_context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;binaryFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas_opts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;sheetname&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;header&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;parsing_func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;functools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;partial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pd_dfs_from_excel_rdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas_opts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pandas_opts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;parsed_excel_sheets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;excel_files_rdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;flatMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;parsing_func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presto!  If we give Pandas Excel files, we get back an RDD that contains (file path, sheet name, sheet df) tuples.  The other magic that happens here is with the &lt;code&gt;partial&lt;/code&gt;.  Our map function takes an RDD record and some Pandas options, but Spark will only pass in the former.  So, we create some Pandas options, create a partial that only takes RDD entries, and we're off.  You can change the &lt;code&gt;pandas_opts&lt;/code&gt; to your liking and things will still work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Going From Pandas DFs to Spark DFs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people probably aren't going to want to stop with a collection of Pandas DFs.  Far more interesting and performant things can be done with Spark DFs.  PySpark contains the &lt;a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/api/python/pyspark.sql.html#pyspark.sql.SQLContext.createDataFrame"&gt;SQLContext.createDataFrame&lt;/a&gt;, which has the folling snippet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When schema is None, it will try to infer the schema (column names and types) from data, which should be an RDD of Row, or namedtuple, or dict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, that's simple enough.  We can take our Pandas DFs, convert them to Spark &lt;code&gt;Row&lt;/code&gt; objects, and as long as they're homogenous, Spark will recognize it as a data frame.  Here's how I accomplished that in a project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;flatten_pd_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pd_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    Given a Pandas DF that has appropriately named columns, this function will iterate the rows and generate Spark Row&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    objects.  It&amp;#39;s recommended that this method be invoked via Spark&amp;#39;s `flatMap`.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    :param pd_df: &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    :return: &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;series&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;iterrows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Takes a row of a df, exports it as a dict, and then passes an unpacked-dict into the Row constructor&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;row_dict&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;k&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;series&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;to_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;row_dict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rows&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;spark_df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some_sql_context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;createDataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rdd_of_rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function will get each Pandas data frame, iterate through it's rows as a dictionary, and use this dictionary to instantiate a Spark &lt;code&gt;Row&lt;/code&gt; object.  At the end of this, we have an RDD of &lt;code&gt;Row&lt;/code&gt;s.  Happy days!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Closing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not that I hope that anyone has to deal with tons and tons of Excel data, but if you do, hopefully this is of use.  If it was, drop me a line!

During this process, we were using PySpark's &lt;code&gt;pyspark.sql.types.DateType&lt;/code&gt; to store date information.  At some point, we decided that we wanted more precision, so we opted to use &lt;code&gt;pyspark.sql.types.TimestampType&lt;/code&gt; instead.  When switching, we noticed a considerable slow-down.  What once was a processor-intensive task was now failing to occupy all cores of our cluster, causing an obvious slow-down.  What gives, Spark?  The goal of this post is to explore why this happens in Spark 2.1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Demonstrating the Performance Impact&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before going any further, I suppose that I should give a concrete example of this issue.  To make it easy to follow this demonstration, I'm going to use a &lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/tree/master/all-spark-notebook"&gt;Docker container provided by Project Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; that includes Spark and Jupyter notebook.  I'll leave it to the reader to get a container running and a notebook open if they want to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see the &lt;a href="https://brianstempin.com/notebooks/Timestamp+demonstration.html"&gt;full notebook here&lt;/a&gt;, but for the sake of the article I'm going to be brief.  Imagine that you have a dataframe with one million dates and a second one with one million timestamps.  Let's call them &lt;code&gt;date_df&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;timestamp_df&lt;/code&gt;, respectively.  In order to demonstrate this issue, we need to perform some actions on them.  Let's pretend we have the following code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;date_identity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;some_date&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;timestamp_identity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;date_identity_udf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;udf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;date_identity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DateType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp_identity_udf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;udf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp_identity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;TimestampType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These identity functions don't do anything; they simply return what they're given.  Let's try to apply these transformations to their respective data frames.  YMMV - the important thing here is not the absolute numbers, but the numbers relative to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transformed_date_df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;withColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;identity&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;date_identity_udf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some_date&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transformed_date_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;transformed_timestamp_df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;withColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;identity&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp_identity_udf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some_timestamp&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timeit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;transformed_timestamp_df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The numbers I got for those calculations, operating on a million items each on a rather large VM was 0.68 and 18.27 seconds, respectively.  That means the identity function for the &lt;code&gt;TimestampType&lt;/code&gt; took over 26 times longer to run!  Where was all of this time going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Data Serialization and Interlanguage Communication&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spark is not written in Python, so what happens when we write Spark code in Python?  In the case that we're doing operations on dataframes and columns, we're simply using Python to build a plan, allowing Spark do all of the work.  In this case, little or no actual Python code is run on any of the worker nodes.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when we introduce something like a Python UDF?  Well, now we are forcing Spark to run Python code on each of the workers.  Spark is not written in Python, so some work has to be done to take data out of the JVM memory model and marshal it into something that Python can interpret and work with.  This is in part where some of the &lt;code&gt;pyspark.sql.types&lt;/code&gt; module comes in.  Let's take a look at the &lt;a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.1.1/api/python/_modules/pyspark/sql/types.html#TimestampType"&gt;source for one of the dta types&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nc"&gt;TimestampType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;AtomicType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;__metaclass__&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DataTypeSingleton&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;needConversion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;toInternal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="n"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;calendar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timegm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utctimetuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tzinfo&lt;/span&gt;
                       &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mktime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timetuple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()))&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;microsecond&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;fromInternal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# using int to avoid precision loss in float&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fromtimestamp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;//&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;microsecond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Sorry for the code being hard to read -- I need to fix my theme)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see that this class appears to be responsible for marshalling/unmarshalling between Python and Spark data types.  The &lt;code&gt;toInternal()&lt;/code&gt; method takes timestamps and turns them into Python &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;s (if you're using Python 3, that is...) and &lt;code&gt;fromInternal()&lt;/code&gt; takes an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; and returns a &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt;.  Since our UDF isn't doing any real work, it would lead us to believe that the only task benig carried out is this data conversion.  Let's test it to see if we can prove this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Breaking Apart the Marshalling and Unmarshalling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we want to do is to time how long it takes to convert date-&amp;gt;int, int-&amp;gt;date, timestamp-&amp;gt;int, and int-&amp;gt;timestamp.  If any of these pop out at us, then we will be able to narrow down our performance problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're interested in the code used to test each part of the process, I suggest you take a look at &lt;a href="https://brianstempin.com/notebooks/Timestamp+demonstration.html"&gt;the notebook&lt;/a&gt; that was used to run the test.  Here are the results I came up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;date-&amp;gt;int:  0.619 sec, baseline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int-&amp;gt;date:  1.889 sec, ~200% increase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;timestamp-&amp;gt;int:  18.260 sec, ~2800% increase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;int-&amp;gt;timestamp:  52.889 sec, ~8400% increase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few conclusions we can draw here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dates are always cheaper than timestamps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going from a numeric type to a Python &lt;code&gt;datetime.date&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;datetime.datetime&lt;/code&gt; is more expensive than the opposite operation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last thing that I'd like to present is a screenshot of &lt;code&gt;htop&lt;/code&gt;.  During the date operations, all cores are busy.  Here's what it looks like during the timestamp operations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="y u no use all coares, Spark?!" src="https://brianstempin.com/images/pyspark-underutilization.png" title="Underutilized cores"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a clear sign of contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;An Attempt to Circumvent the Contention&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, we've identified, on a shallow level, the operations that are causing a slow-down and some contention.  I'm not entirely sure why.  In order to answer that, I'd really have to dig through the Spark source code.  Instead of doing that, I'd like to share an approach that a colleague and I came up with to significantly speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of doing calculations that return &lt;code&gt;timestamps&lt;/code&gt;, we do calculations that ultimately return &lt;code&gt;long&lt;/code&gt;s and have Spark cast them to &lt;code&gt;timestamps&lt;/code&gt;.  Here's an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;timestamp_to_long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="sd"&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    This function takes a timestamp and returns it as microseconds from epoc, respecting timezone.  If no tzinfo is specified,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    UTC is assumed.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    :param dt:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    :return:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="sd"&gt;    &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kc"&gt;None&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tzinfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tzinfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1970&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tzinfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timezone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;utc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;timedelta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;microseconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;some_timestamp_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# User magic happens here, then we convert to a long&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;timestamp_to_long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class="n"&gt;ts_udf&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;udf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;some_timestamp_function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LongType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;withColumn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;manipulated_ts&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ts_udf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;col&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;some_ts_col&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;timestamp&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we know it works?  In short, it worked in our case.  We had an ETL job that was manipulating about seven billion dates with a UDF which ran sluggisly and had very poor processor utilization.  The only change we made was to return &lt;code&gt;longs&lt;/code&gt; and cast them...that's it!  All of the date math/manipulation/etc happens with the &lt;code&gt;datetime.datetime&lt;/code&gt; class withing a pure Python UDF.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, where's my proof?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't really have any...if I were to repeat the tests above where we swap out the identity UDFs for UDFs that return &lt;code&gt;longs&lt;/code&gt;, we get similar times.  The only explanation that comes to mind is that Spark is able to do additional operations when using our fix that it can't do otherwise, so the increase we see in CPU utilization is not caused by our method of &lt;code&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt; handling, but rather Spark's ability to do other operations at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why this slowdown happens and why my proposed fix works (in my case...YMMV) is a bit of a mystery to me, but I intend to keep trying to find a way to demonstrate it!  I'd also be interested to hear if you've had significant slowdowns due to &lt;code&gt;timestamp&lt;/code&gt; manipulation or if this fix helps you.

In our case, we have some reports to run and deliver.  Our app, like lots of internet apps, is distributed and runs in a Docker container on Amazon's Elastic Beanstalk.  So, what are our options?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How About Cron?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt;'s been the go-to solution for this type of problem for some years.  It's simple:  you edit a file to give it the schedule, tell it what program to execute, and BAM!  Instant scheduled tasks!  Unfortunately, it wasn't this simple for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Distributed Apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; isn't great for distributed apps.  How do you handle concurrency?  Do all machines in a cluster attempt to run the task with some sort of central locking?  Do you just schedule the task on one machine and hope that particular machine never dies?  &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; is great for simple, single-machien apps, but has issues once the topic of distribution of work is broached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Docker Containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that running &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; in Docker containers is not easy.  For one, many people use environment variables to configure their containers, which can be problematic:  these variables are often not visible to the command that &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; schedules.  I once used &lt;a href="https://www.ekito.fr/people/run-a-cron-job-with-docker/"&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;, which was great, but commenters mentioned this flaw.  At my company, we often use environment variables to store things like database credentials for use in Django, so this kind of hurt.  How am I supposed to run a Django command on a regular basis if these variables aren't visible?  One answer was to &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26822067/running-cron-python-jobs-within-docker"&gt;wrap &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; with a Python script&lt;/a&gt;, but this seemed like a lot of work and over-kill.  No, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;External Scheduling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it's not practial to expect every machine in a distributed environment to try to kick off some process, I decided that maybe it was best to have an external agent to call into our app to start a process.  Imagine for a moment that some central scheduluer machine, running &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt;, called a special URL in my app.  This could be something like, &lt;code&gt;https://my-app/admin/start-daily-processes&lt;/code&gt; and it could be secured with some sort of token authentication so that only designated callers could trigger it.  This solves the first problem (the distributed environment), but not the second one (&lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; doesn't play well with Docker).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a look through AWS's documentation and took a look at &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/"&gt;Lambda&lt;/a&gt;.  Lambda would allow me to write some piece of code, perhaps something to make a web service call, and to not have to worry about how it's called or where it's run.  This sounded good to me for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This required minimal permissions.  All the script would be doing was to make an HTTP call, so no roles or special IAM privileges would be needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It required minimal code.  &lt;code&gt;urllib3&lt;/code&gt; is already installed in the Lambda environment, so the code that I would have to write would be quite small.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's free.  Once call per day running on the minimal settings for less than a second per run falls well within the free tier.  It's an extra moving part without being an extra cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How would I trigger this thing, though?  Well, it turns out that Lambda and CloudWatch have an answer to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a Lambda function.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the "Events sources tab."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on "Add event source" and select the "CloudWatch Evnets - Schedule" option.  This will prompt you to create a CloudWatch rule with a &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt;-like syntax that triggers your Lambda function on a regular schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the dialog to schedule the event:
&lt;img alt="CloudWatch Events - Schedule dialog" src="https://brianstempin.com/images/lambda-add-event-source-screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a screenshot of the rule in CloudWatch:
&lt;img alt="CouldWatch rule" src="https://brianstempin.com/images/lambda-screenshot.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for the user, Lambda will have links to the CloudWatch rule and vice versa.  This makes management pretty easy.  By this point, I had some Lambda that could tell my app to start processes that needed to run on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had the following problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; didn't run well (at all?) in Docker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; did not work well for a distributed app&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A special controller in my web app, using token auth, that started a background process when invoked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An AWS Lambda function which invoked this URL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An AWS CloudWatch rule (configured via Lambda) that triggered this Lambda function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has the following advantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's distributed app friendly:  Lambda doesn't care who gets the request, but that they carry it out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's reliable:  CloudWatch and Lambda are both run by AWS, so you don't have to worry about maintenance, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's cheap, if not free:  My use of Lambda falls within the free tier.  I'm pretty sure my CloudWatch usage does as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lambda function has the ability to alert you if it wasn't able to kick off the task:  It could use a Slack hook or something similar to alert users that it didn't get a &lt;code&gt;200 OK&lt;/code&gt; back from the app when trying to invoke it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also has the following disadvantages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing is in one place:  There are 3 different systems at work here:  Yours, Lambda, and CloudWatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Additional tooling:  I wrote my Lambda function without putting it in source control and without having some sort of build/deploy process.  This requires additional tooling and/or setup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending on your usage, it might add cost:  If you have a ton of things to schedule, then you might end up paying for Lambda and/or CloudWatch usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're new to this approach, so while I wish that I could write about it being rock-solid even after the end of Earth as we know it, I simply can't.  What I can say is that this feels much more natural than &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt; and has served us well so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General Work Stuff"></category><category term="AWS"></category><category term="tools"></category></entry><entry><title>Introducing PySwfAws</title><link href="https://brianstempin.com/2015/12/23/introducing-pyswfaws/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-23T16:18:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-12-23T16:18:00-05:00</updated><author><name>bstempi</name></author><id>tag:brianstempin.com,2015-12-23:/2015/12/23/introducing-pyswfaws/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bottom line up front:&lt;/p&gt;

The tasks are durable because their request goes to a durable queue.  If the task fails, then it can be retried.  If the node dies, then some other node will be assigned the request.  The process that creates these requests, however, is not durable.  If the scheduling process dies the work will continue, but there will be no one to alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that we needed this state.  We decided that we needed Amazon's &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/swf/"&gt;SWF&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Brief Intro to SWF&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally found Amazon's description confusing, so here's mine.  In short:  there are two different kinds of workers:  deciders and activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activity workers are just like tasks in Celery.  They get some sort of request, do work, and return a result (I succeeded/failed, or "42").&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciders are where the magic is found.  In something like Celery, the process requesting tasks is, itself, not part of Celery.  It has no durable state.  The SWF decider is the opposite of that.  The workflow state is tracked by SWF.  It might look something like, "Hey, you schedueled 100 tasks; 15 are done, 10 are running, and 1 failed."  Every time that state changes, SWF schedules a decider task.  It guarantees that there is only 1 decision happening for any given workflow, so you don't have to worry about concurrency issues.  When a decision task runs, it is passed the workflow state and has an opportunity to make decisions.  It can say things like, "Hey, let's reschedule that one task that failed," or, "We really needed that one task, so let's fail the whole workflow and cancel any pending work," or, "I don't care about that failed task, carry on."  The key part here is that the decider is stateless.  If the node that is running a decision dies, then some other node will pick up the decison task and issue decisions.  SWF handles the tricky bit of managing the state, and all you have to do is write these two types of workers.  Sounds easy, doesn't it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;It's Not Easy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously:  it's not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine for a minute that your decider program took in a list of events.  Those events might reference eachother (e.g., "event 3 was scheduled because of event 2").  There are something like 60-90 different event types.  Trying to build some sort of state machine around a list of events is quite tedious.  Can you imagine having to write the case statement or if-else ladder from hell?  Me, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Frameworks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone at Amazon recognized this and the &lt;a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonswf/latest/awsflowguide/welcome.html"&gt;Flow&lt;/a&gt; frameworks were born.  There are two versions:  one for Java and one for Ruby.  Unfortunately, this doesn't help us in Python land.  &lt;a href="http://docs.pythonboto.org/en/latest/"&gt;Boto&lt;/a&gt; will allow us to interact directly with the API, but it will not help with unraveling that heap of events in our decider programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that the Flow framework operates is by using a "replay" strategy.  In short:  the decider is written as if it is calling the activity task directly.  The framework intercepts the call and will "fill it in."  For instance, if it was never seen before, then it will be scheduled.  If it was requested in a previous invocation, the framework will stub it with the last known state.  Later in the program when the user tries to access the results of some activity worker, the framework will again intercept the call.  If the result exists, it will be retrieved from the history and returned.  If it doesn't exist, then the execution of the decier program will stop; any decisions that were noted will be returned to SWF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Building a Framework in Python Using the Replay Strategy&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided that this strategy was wise and that I wanted to do the same thing.  First thing's first:  how do I intercept calls?  I decided to use &lt;a href="http://venusian.readthedocs.org/en/latest/"&gt;Venusian&lt;/a&gt; decorators.  Unlike regular decorators, Venusian allows me to wait until runtime to decide which function should serve as the decorator for some given decoration.  This way, I can make the behavior be dynamic.  Is the project running in "local-mode"?  Allow the function calls to pass through.  Is the project running in "distributed-mode"?  Intercept the calls and do magic in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running things in local mode is somewhat trivial, so let's gloss pass that for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running things in distributed mode is a bit more difficult.  What do I need to intercept and how do I do it?  When running a decider program, we want to intercept calls to activity workers.  What do we return?  In my case:  a &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;.  The idea here is that the user may always expect activities inside of a decider to return a &lt;code&gt;Promise&lt;/code&gt;.  They may check to see if that promise is complete (&lt;code&gt;Promise.is_ready&lt;/code&gt;) or they may attempt to get it's result (&lt;code&gt;Promise.result&lt;/code&gt;).  When running in distributed mode, we will populate this promise using the workflow history.  If the user attempts to get the result of a promise before it is ready, we stop the execution of the decider program.  Any new decisions that were made during the program's run will be returned to SWF.  If the decider program successfully returns, then we consider the workflow to be complete.  If it throws an exception, then we consider it failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Examples&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple exaple of an activity worker.  We'll pretend that all of the imports are taken care of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@activity_task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;example&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_task_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;TestActivityA&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_task_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1.0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_task_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;activity_a_unit_test&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activity_task_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the decorator tells the framework how to communicate with SWF by giving it the domain, task type, task version, and task list to use when communicating.  Let's look an example decider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@decision_task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;example&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_workflow_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;TestWorkflow&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_workflow_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1.0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_task_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;unit_test_a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decider_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activity_task_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;activity_task_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like with our worker, we have some context in the decorator that allows the framework to figure out how to communicate with AWS.  Here is an example to run the activity worker and decider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;activity_task_a_runner = DistributedActivityWorker(activity_task_a)
activity_task_a_runner.start()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;decision_task_a_runner = DistributedDecisionWorker(decider_a)
decision_task_a_runner.start()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;DistributedActivityWorker&lt;/code&gt; is reponsible for connecting to SWF, asking for tasks, parsing the results, and passing them to the user's activity task function.  Pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;DistributedDecisionWorker&lt;/code&gt; does a similar job.  It will contact SWF and ask for a decison task.  It will then parse the results and use the history to stub out any promises that the user asks for.  In our example, &lt;code&gt;a1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;a2&lt;/code&gt; will be stubbed out by promises.  By the last line of &lt;code&gt;decider_a()&lt;/code&gt;, the user is requesting the results of those calculations.  If they don't exist, execution of that method will cease and control will be returned to the &lt;code&gt;DistributedDecisionWorker&lt;/code&gt;, which will handle how to return results to SWF.  Much simpler than having to parse your own histories, right?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Gotchas&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The replay method comes with a big gotcha:  programs must be determinisitc.  If a workflow has 1,000 events, then your decider program &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; get called up to 1,000 times.  This means that things like hitting a database or generating a random number might happen more than once and will likely have different results eac time, causing your program to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other gotchas that apply to SWF that are worth discussing here.  One is that there is a limit to how large your response objects may be.  This means that there is also a limit to how much data a given activity or decider may return.  This can be painful if you're passing around datasets for transformation or music files for processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Framework Extras&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PySwfAws has some features to mitigate the gotchas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;@cached&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;@cached&lt;/code&gt; decorator allows you to cache the call of a method.  Let's say that we have the followning method:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;accessDb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;:
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;doSomeQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ss"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This method may not be deterministic.  If the underlying data changes or the results are not reliably ordered, then this function is probably not deterministic.  By putting the &lt;code&gt;@cached&lt;/code&gt; decorator to it, you cache each function invocation.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@decision_task&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;example&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_workflow_type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;TestWorkflow&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_workflow_version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;1.0&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;swf_task_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;unit_test_a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;decider_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accessDb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accessDb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;call2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@cached&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accessDb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;doSomeQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;code&gt;accessDb()&lt;/code&gt; is invoked twice in the decider function.  No matter how many times that decider function is called, the &lt;code&gt;accessDb()&lt;/code&gt; function will only be invoked twice.  Each time, the results will be cached.  That means that even if this program runs 1,000 times during a workflow, exactly two invocations will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Out of Band Storage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens when the thing that you want to cache is too large to store in SWF?  What if the arguments to a task or the return value of a task are too large?  SWF has no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PySwfAws will allow you to store data outside of SWF.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;@cached&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result_data_serializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;JsonSerializer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;result_data_store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;S3DataStore&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;bucket&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;swf-data&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;accessDb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;doSomeQuery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By passing options to the &lt;code&gt;@cached&lt;/code&gt; decorator, we can tell it to store the cached result as JSON into some bucket named &lt;code&gt;swf-data&lt;/code&gt; on S3.  Similar options exist on the activity and decision task decorators to control how input &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; output are serialized and stored.  For instance, you can take your input as JSON from SWF and then save the results as Protobuf in S3.  You are now free to throw as much data as you want around SWF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Timers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SWF has the notion of timers.  Using this feature, you could implement reliable CRON tasks.  The way that a user can invoke a timer in a decier program is by using a promise like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;promise&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PTimer&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;timer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PTimer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;timer&lt;/code&gt; variable will be a promise.  When the promise is ready, then the timer has "fired."  If you call &lt;code&gt;timer.result&lt;/code&gt;, it'll return &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;.  The idea here is that you can call &lt;code&gt;timer.result&lt;/code&gt; in order to force your program to wait for that timer to fire.  It will either return or cause execution to cease until the timer is ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, this project is in Alpha.  I activley use it at work, but it is quite unstable at the moment.  Please use at your own risk and feel free to submit pull requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to keep activley working on this and we intend to rely on it quite heavily at Showroom Logic.  I'm not quite sure what 1.0 looks like because I have yet to make a roadmap.  Eventually, I'll create one.  For right now, the numbering is a bit arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Unrelated Note:  Naming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand that the project's name is awful.  I orginally wanted to name it PySwf, but that name was already taken by a project that deals with Flash projects.  I'll rename it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General Work Stuff"></category><category term="Python"></category><category term="AWS"></category><category term="tools"></category></entry><entry><title>JetBrians DataGrip Review</title><link href="https://brianstempin.com/2015/12/21/jetbrains-datagrip-review/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-21T20:27:00-05:00</published><updated>2015-12-21T20:27:00-05:00</updated><author><name>bstempi</name></author><id>tag:brianstempin.com,2015-12-21:/2015/12/21/jetbrains-datagrip-review/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/"&gt;JetBrains&lt;/a&gt; released a new product called &lt;a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/"&gt;DataGrip&lt;/a&gt;.

It's basically IntelliJ for databases, and so far, I love it!  Granted:  I'm biased.  I do all of my Java and Python development using IntelliJ and PyCharm, respectively.  That being said, I think that even if I were still using some other IDE on a day-to-day basis, DataGrip would still be at the top of my list as a general database access and manipulation tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Making Quick Data Analysis Quicker&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know about you, but I really hate the &lt;code&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt; command line tool.  It lacks autocomplete and is really picky.  &lt;code&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt;, however, is a really handy tool for doing some quick analysis of CSVs or TSVs, so I end up using it quite a bit.  In my few uses of DataGrip, I used it instead of the &lt;code&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt; command line client to query databases that I had already built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Observation One: Adding a New Data Source Was Kind of Confusing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, DG doesn't come with any (many?  I'm not sure) of the drivers installed!  This was really confusing the first time I tried to add a data source.  To DG's credit:  if you go to the driver screen, you can click a download link that will get and install the driver for you.  I understand that licensing issues sometimes prevent vendors from including libraries such as these in their products.  What I don't get, however, is why they didn't take this ease-of-installation feature a step further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot showing the drivers screen" src="https://brianstempin.com/images/download-driver-screenshot.png" title="Screenshot showing the drivers screen.  WTF, JetBrains?!"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they detect that this is the firs time that I've run this product, why not offer to download them all for me?  If JetBrains is ok giving me a download and installation facility, then they should present it to me up-front so that I can download all of the drivers I need and never think of it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Observation Two:  The Autocomplete is Really Nice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that autocomplete has been around forever, but there's something especially nice about this one.  It's snappy.  Very snappy.  Exceptionally snappy.  Perhaps this might change once I throw larger schemas at it, but it's snappy enough to remind me of why I left &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;-land in the first place and to be glad to see JetBrains releasing new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Observation Three:  Exporting Results is a Breeze&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm doing a quick or one-off analysis, I usually want to export the results so that I can chart it or sent it to a colleague.  The export tools are wonderful.  There aren't a ton of formats that you can export into, but the ones that I would expect were present.  You can also "export to clipboard," allowing you to copy-paste results easily.  For someone that's running exploratory queries that have relatively small result sets, this is pretty awesome.  It allows me to easily put my output into a web page (as JSON or CSV) for charting (in my case, I use &lt;a href="http://nvd3.org/"&gt;NVD3&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Overall&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataGrip is a pretty cool tool.  Lately I haven't had a go-to tool for connecting to and running SQL queries.  This just became "it" for me.  I'm curious to see what it does on larger queries with larger result sets.  I'm sure the tool has it's limits, but from what I've seen, I'm confident they're pretty sane and reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm looking forward to find ways to leverage DG to chart and graph data as quickly as I can query it.  Good job, JetBrains!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="General Work Stuff"></category><category term="tools"></category><category term="database"></category></entry><entry><title>Perhaps You've Noticed: I Have a New Blog</title><link href="https://brianstempin.com/2015/04/06/new-blog/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-06T19:15:00-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-06T19:15:00-04:00</updated><author><name>bstempi</name></author><id>tag:brianstempin.com,2015-04-06:/2015/04/06/new-blog/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yep, that's right...I kicked WordPress to the curb and decided to do the whole staticly-generated-pages-thing.

originally started this blog, WordPress just made the most sense.  It was easy to install, easy to maintain, had plenty
of skins and plugins available, and just worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, why the departure?  The reason is two-fold:  &lt;a href="http://www.bluehost.com/"&gt;bluehost&lt;/a&gt; is slow, and I don't write often
enough to justify the WordPress maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluehost being slow was definitely the biggest factor for me.  I helped develop a WordPress site for &lt;a href="http://play0ad.com/"&gt;0 A.D.&lt;/a&gt;
and it runs much, much faster than my blog.  The 0 A.D. site has a lot more plugins, themeing, traffic, and activity than
my blog, yet it runs tons faster.  It's not that they use some sort of super-servers or anything like that.  I think it's
because bluehost just does a crappy job at making sure that their machines aren't shared between too many different sites.
The convenience just isn't worth the bad impression that a slow site makes on visitors (some of which are potential employers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, WordPress upgrades and major releases cost me more time than writing does.  If I can't be bothered with making sure that
my theme and plugins work with the newest release, then why bother?  This also means that hosting isn't an option for me,
either.  I definitely don't want to have to worry about my VPS getting &lt;a href="http://funnystack.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Funny-Weightlifting-40.jpg"&gt;b0rked&lt;/a&gt;
because of the latest 0-day exploit.  It's just not worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Static Pages to the Rescue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static pages solve all of these problems.  I don't have to worry about updates or server vulnerabilities.  I don't have
to worry about 0-days coming along and murdering my content.  I don't have to worry about speed.  Everything is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's also cheaper.  I'm currently having my blog hosted via &lt;a href="https://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; for free, but I
could have just as easily hosted it on S3 and Cloudfront for less than a dollar a month since I don't see a huge amount
of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Tooling&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how do I go about making static pages?  I use a tool called &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.  It's pretty
similar to &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, except that it's written in Python and not Ruby.  I settled on Pelican because
I have familiarity with the Python stack and because I happen to already have a bunch of Python stuff installed.
It also has some nice tools for porting content from WordPress.  The only thing that I had to handle after porting the
content was manually porting the images and fixing links.  That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publishing is pretty simple, too.  Once I generate the content, I just use &lt;a href="https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import"&gt;ghp-import&lt;/a&gt;
to check it into GitHub, and wa-la!  My content is posted.  I could use something like TravisCI to do this for me, but
it's a bit of a pain to have to find a way to share credentials with a build service like that.  It's just simpler for me
to run the one extra command after a commit and push to publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love how much faster and easier it is to maintain my blog.  Getting Pelican &amp;amp; co set up might sound intimidating, but
it's not.  It's very much worth it.  I should have done this a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Free Time"></category><category term="Python"></category></entry><entry><title>Update to my Vindinium Client</title><link href="https://brianstempin.com/2014/10/20/update-to-my-vindinium-client/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-20T22:27:00-04:00</published><updated>2014-10-20T22:27:00-04:00</updated><author><name>bstempi</name></author><id>tag:brianstempin.com,2014-10-20:/2014/10/20/update-to-my-vindinium-client/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://brianstempin.com/2014/09/28/vindinium/"&gt;previously

&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different interfaces for writing a bot:

&lt;p&gt;There are two different interfaces for writing a bot:
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client/blob/1.0.0/src/main/java/com/brianstempin/vindiniumclient/bot/simple/SimpleBot.java"&gt;SimpleBot&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client/blob/1.0.0/src/main/java/com/brianstempin/vindiniumclient/bot/advanced/AdvancedBot.java"&gt;AdvancedBot&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;The SimpleBot interface is just a Java representation of the GameState
as defined by Vindinium. &amp;nbsp;As such, the map is represented as a string,
forcing each bot to do its own parsing, etc. &amp;nbsp;AdvancedBot takes this
further with an AdvancedGameState, which provides a board graph and
provides a hash map for indexing the players, mines, and pubs by
position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each bot package also comes with a callable to run the game loop. &amp;nbsp;The
Callable will handle parsing the game state, invoking the bot, and
communication. &amp;nbsp;Once a bot is written, it just needs to be instantiated
and passed to the appropriate bot runner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For ease of use, a Main class is provided that can run a bot on the
class path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="example-bots"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Example Bots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vindinium.org/ai/dmyaf50l"&gt;my bot's score&lt;/a&gt;, I'm no
bot expert. &amp;nbsp;Still, I included some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SimpleMurderBot does one thing: &amp;nbsp;it shanks. &amp;nbsp;It does a simple Dijkstra
search on the board and looks for the closest bot to stab. &amp;nbsp;If it gets
low on health, it'll look for the nearest tavern. &amp;nbsp;It does not
discriminate or take mines. &amp;nbsp;It literally just goes after the nearest
bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AdvancedMurderBot is a little more interesting. &amp;nbsp;It also uses Dijkstra
to do its search, but its decisioning is more advanced. &amp;nbsp;After reading
about Behavior Trees, I decided to try my hand at implementing them.
&amp;nbsp;Because this game isn't real-time, the implementation was much simpler
than some of the examples I came across. &amp;nbsp;I have a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client/blob/1.0.0/src/main/java/com/brianstempin/vindiniumclient/bot/advanced/murderbot/Decision.java"&gt;Decision&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;class
that, given some state, will return some move. &amp;nbsp;The state and move are
generics so that other bot designers might use different game state
types. &amp;nbsp;As an example of why someone might want to do this, I created an
inner class within AdvancedMurderBot that contains the AdvancedGameState
and a Dijkstra search. &amp;nbsp;This enriched game state is what I pass to each
of my decisioners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my implementation, I wrote several Decision nodes, each of which
might return a move itself or decide to delegate to some other decision
node. &amp;nbsp;The nodes could be assembled any which way. &amp;nbsp;In my case, I chose
to assemble them as a DAG in order to make them easier to reason about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both bots also contain some pretty bad flaws. &amp;nbsp;The biggest of these is
definitely the routing. &amp;nbsp;SimpleMurderBot will simply try to walk through
other bots and doesn't consider them obstacles. &amp;nbsp;AdvancedMurderBot will
avoid other bots that aren't targets, but it won't walk far enough
around them to avoid a fight. &amp;nbsp;Rather, it will just walk next to them,
provoking a strike. &amp;nbsp;Another interesting flaw is the lack of loop
detection. &amp;nbsp;Both bots are vulnerable to getting into infinite loops at
the pub with other bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="go-forth-and-extend"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go Forth and Extend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in my README that I think the AdvancedGameState still leaves
something to be desired. &amp;nbsp;I think that my routing is pretty crummy, too,
so I'll be working on those things for my next release. &amp;nbsp;If you spot a
flaw, something that you think just sucks, or an improvement, feel free
to send me a pull request. &amp;nbsp;I'd be happy to have your improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Is Vindinium?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vindinium is an AI competition. &amp;nbsp;Its a game that is played exclusively
by bots. &amp;nbsp;You could create a bot that takes input from a human player,
but the required response time makes it impractical. &amp;nbsp;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vindinium.org/doc"&gt;game
rules&lt;/a&gt; are fairly simple, which makes the
barrier-of-entry fairly low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-the-rub"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's the Rub?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game's object model is not easy to deal with. &amp;nbsp;The entire map state
is sent back to you each time, so its up to the client to determine
which parts are mutable vs. immutable. &amp;nbsp;The map is represented as a
string and an integer that tells you the length of one side of the map
(all maps are square). &amp;nbsp;Without a good client, the bot has to manually
parse the map string, build graphs to represent the map, etc. &amp;nbsp;This is
work that shouldn't need to be repeated for each bot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-wrote-a-simple-client"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Wrote a Simple Client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keyword in the title is, &amp;quot;simple.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;I wrote a client (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client"&gt;posted on
Github&lt;/a&gt;) that handles
the HTTP and JSON bits using Google's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/google-http-java-client/"&gt;HTTP
client&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/"&gt;GSON&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. &amp;nbsp;The
game state passed to the Bot interface is just a Java representation of
the GameState class. &amp;nbsp;Its as bare-bones as ones gets and it has the
problems described in the previous paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My hope is to write a few more advanced clients. &amp;nbsp;One of the things I'd
like to achieve is to have a game state that's much easier to deal with.
&amp;nbsp;It'd be nice if the game map was presented to the bot as a graph along
with a few hash maps to tell the bot where the taverns, players, and
chests are. &amp;nbsp;Another thing I would like to handle is mutltithreading.
&amp;nbsp;The client should respond with a default move should the bot be taking
too long to calculate a move. &amp;nbsp;The bot should also be provided some
background threads to do calculations, such as forecasting and
pathfinding, while the other bots are moving. &amp;nbsp;Ideally, I'll add these
things to my current project as additional options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="i-also-have-a-working-bot"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;I Also Have a Working Bot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vindinium.org/ai/ty4jugtu"&gt;SimpleMurderBot&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bstempi/vindinium-client/blob/master/src/main/java/com/brianstempin/vindiniumclient/bot/MurderBot.java"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;)
just runs to the nearest player and stabs them. &amp;nbsp;If it has money and is
low on health, it'll run for beer. &amp;nbsp;Thats it...super simple. &amp;nbsp;I would
like to write a bot with a more serious strategy, but for now,
SimpleMurderBot is pretty fun to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="hop-in"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hop In!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://vindinium.org/starters"&gt;starter packs&lt;/a&gt;,
and writing a client is fairly simple. &amp;nbsp;I'd really like to see this game
catch on.&lt;/p&gt;

terribly over-complicating this problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="you-know-buzz-words"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Know, Buzz Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were places that I worked that used, loved, and worshipped certain
tools for no good reason. &amp;nbsp;Many of these tools had qualities worth
loving; but that's not why they were loved. &amp;nbsp;They were loved for
being &lt;em&gt;enterprise&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;WTF does that even mean?&amp;quot; some might ask. &amp;nbsp;Dare
not ask this out-loud unless you want a hurricane of buzzwords to come
your way. &amp;nbsp;Most people can't give you much of an answer, myself
included. &amp;nbsp;I will try to define it nonetheless with a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once worked with someone who loved the Spring Framework, specifically
its caching framework, which is a wrapper on EHCache. &amp;nbsp;This person
loved, loved, loved it. &amp;nbsp;They claimed that it made coding much easier
and made the app run faster. &amp;nbsp;It was like fairy dust for Java. &amp;nbsp;After
rooting around their code, I discovered that fairy dust didn't fix
stupidity. This individual's code would periodically query the
database, build maps from the response, and cache them to prevent
further database hits. &amp;nbsp;The problem was that these maps were never
addressed by key -- they were traversed linearly. &amp;nbsp;It was the worst of
two worlds: &amp;nbsp;a slow building structure that was being queried in a slow
way. &amp;nbsp;You see, the keys were just a concatenated string of several of
the values within its respective entry. &amp;nbsp;No part of the application had
enough data to recreate this key. &amp;nbsp;Ever. &amp;nbsp;It was an order of magnitude
faster to query the database for a specific item than it was to try to
search this unsorted heap of shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it was enterprise, and thus it was unquestionably better. &amp;nbsp;Also,
this seasoned developer didn't know what a hash map was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mocking-that-mindset"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mocking That Mindset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what this project is all about. &amp;nbsp;It mocks people who want
enterprise-y things just because its &lt;em&gt;enterprise&lt;/em&gt;. It mocks PHBs who
throw buzzwords around until someone gets hit in the eye. &amp;nbsp;It mocks
people who abstract for no reason. &amp;nbsp;It mocks people who think that
caches, and in turn, hash maps, are &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;magic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="contribute"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, and so should you! &amp;nbsp;I had my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition/pull/124"&gt;first pull
request&lt;/a&gt;
accepted some time ago. &amp;nbsp;In this particular PR, I conquered the Java
vendor-lock-in that is &lt;strong&gt;System.out.println&lt;/strong&gt;! Battling vendor and
API lock-in is my favorite hobby. &amp;nbsp;There are plenty of other great
tickets, such as getting FBEE to run on a map/reduce framework,
WebSphere, and Java 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, its a great way to help you calibrate how much
abstraction is &amp;quot;just right.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;So often, we have people telling us to
abstract more and to be more modular. &amp;nbsp;No one really speaks much to how
one should choose their battles or where to stop. &amp;nbsp;FBEE is a good tool
because it reminds you of what's ridiculous and what &amp;quot;too far&amp;quot; looks
like. &amp;nbsp;Take a read through the code and the tickets, and you'll find
plenty of golden nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/bstempi/projecteuler"&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;When I
started with PHP, I wasn't using anything in the way of a framework. &amp;nbsp;No
MVC-bits, no ORM, no serializer, no dependency management. &amp;nbsp;Nothing.
&amp;nbsp;This is wildly different than my Java development experience, where I
regularly depend on things like Maven for dependency management, Guice
or Spring for dependency injection, and Camel or Hadoop for an
application framework. &amp;nbsp;Where was this stuff for PHP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="it-s-there"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;It's There&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of it was there when I first started with PHP, but a lot of it has
been vastly improved since then. &amp;nbsp;The fact is that I never knew these
types of tools existed 10 years ago. &amp;nbsp;Now that I'm going back and doing
some PHP development, I'm rediscovering the PHP ecosystem. &amp;nbsp;I'm finding
some analogs for my familiar Java stack and some new tools that I wish I
had elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="symfony2"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Symfony2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had read a little bit about the original
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://symfony.com/"&gt;Symfony&lt;/a&gt; a few years back, but I never had much
of a chance to use it. &amp;nbsp;I started writing a few one-off web apps and
decided that I wanted something lighter weight than Java. &amp;nbsp;I remembered
dealing with Symfony, so I took at look to see if it was something that
would suit me. &amp;nbsp;Since I'd last used it, Symfony2 had some out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an awesome piece of software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symfony2 is an absolute pleasure to use. &amp;nbsp;It just kind of makes sense.
&amp;nbsp;I think the most impressive bit about it is that it ties together so
many other tools and does so in a way that allows you to switch out
different tools. &amp;nbsp;It just &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; better than the Java stacks I had
worked with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="composer"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Composer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getcomposer.org/"&gt;Composer&lt;/a&gt; is one of the de facto
dependency management systems in the PHP world and is the one used by
Symfony2. &amp;nbsp;In short: &amp;nbsp;it's simple. &amp;nbsp;It has a JSON file that lists the
library and version dependencies. &amp;nbsp;Thats it...thats enough to get
someone started. &amp;nbsp;It also has a plugin and scripting capabilities like
Maven does, except that it doesn't feel anywhere near as clunky. &amp;nbsp;It
works pretty well and tends to be much less verbose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="friends-of-symfony"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Friends of Symfony&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony"&gt;FOS bundles&lt;/a&gt; are a pretty
awesome addition to Symfony. &amp;nbsp;Specifically, the rest bundle is
top-notch. &amp;nbsp;It just kind of handles routing, serialization, and
validation with relatively little input from me. &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.0.0.M3/reference/html/ch18s02.html"&gt;Spring does
this&lt;/a&gt;,
and I've used Spring for providing data via a RESTful service before.
&amp;nbsp;While the FOSRest bundle has some documentation problems, it was still
much more of a pleasure than dealing with the setup and verbosity of
Spring. &amp;nbsp;Routing in particular is a bit painful with the version of
Spring that I used. &amp;nbsp;Symfony, instead of forcing me to annotate every
method with the URL, allows me to extend a controller class and to
create the methods that I want. &amp;nbsp;If I follow a simple naming convention,
it just works. &amp;nbsp;If I want to override the default URL scheme, I can. &amp;nbsp;It
just feels more powerful, and I don't have to wait for a servlet to
restart between tests. &amp;nbsp;I feel like I'm just sitting around and waiting
less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="doctrine"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doctrine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/"&gt;Doctrine&lt;/a&gt; is the default ORM
packaged with Symfony2. &amp;nbsp;If you've used
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hibernate.org/"&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt;, then Doctrine should seem
familiar. &amp;nbsp;For the most part, they're very similar. &amp;nbsp;They both hydrate
and persist object graphs; they both have a query language; they both
have some sort of caching. &amp;nbsp;My big beef with Hibernate was its dealings
with entity relationships. &amp;nbsp;I felt like Hibernate or the documentation
(I'm not sure which one, and I'm too lazy to find out) made figuring out
which entity should (or did) own a relationship to some other entity a
pain. &amp;nbsp;A royal pain. &amp;nbsp;I remember spending days on that in previous
projects. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I was being thick back then, but I don't remember
having those pains with Doctrine. &amp;nbsp;I felt like the documentation was
much more concise and that relationship management was much easier to
follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="performance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent this entire post gushing over how I've started to really like
Symfony and how I'm getting back into PHP development. &amp;nbsp;The down side?
&amp;nbsp;Performance. &amp;nbsp;Unlike Java, there's no PHP process that sits around and
listens for requests. &amp;nbsp;Also, threading is not a common practice in PHP.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://us2.php.net/pthreads"&gt;Threading exists&lt;/a&gt;, but few use it.
&amp;nbsp;Each request is a process or comes from a process pool. &amp;nbsp;Each requests
is basically an application restart, which can get expensive and is not
great for performance. &amp;nbsp;Event CLI tools like composer can seem slow at
times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there are solutions on the horizon (I haven't tried any yet).
&amp;nbsp;Tools like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/reactphp/react"&gt;Reactor&lt;/a&gt; exist and
claim to erase this cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="its-just-satisfying"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Its Just...Satisfying&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it. &amp;nbsp;For whatever reason, despite some of the (large) down-sides
of PHP, working with is has just been satisfying. &amp;nbsp;I don't know if I'm
actually any more productive, but I certainly feel like it. &amp;nbsp;Anywho,
here's to doing more of my side projects in PHP and to seeing its
ecosystem continue to evolve and grow!&lt;/p&gt;

(eww, I know, forgive me). &amp;nbsp;I opted to run this environment in a VM so
that I don't have to pollute my gaming rig with all kinds of tools,
patches, bit-rot, etc. &amp;nbsp;So, after firing up VirtualBox and getting
Windows 7 installed, it was time to get some tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's the part I hate. &amp;nbsp;Manually installing tools SUCKS. &amp;nbsp;Call me
spoiled, but I enjoy not having to deal with that in Linux.
&amp;nbsp;Specifically, I'm spoiled by APT. &amp;nbsp;With one line and a few minutes, I
can have an entire LAMP setup. &amp;nbsp;No such luck in Windows unless someone
makes a product out of it (like the WAMP product by Alter Way).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enter-the-tool"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enter the Tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd heard of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://chocolatey.org/"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; while I was working
at Coldlight, but I didn't have any time to spend with it. &amp;nbsp;Now that I'm
working on a new project and that I'm on my own time, I was free to do
as I pleased. &amp;nbsp;So I did;&amp;nbsp;I tried it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installation was simple. &amp;nbsp;I copy/pasted the PowerShell one-liner into my
console and let it do it's thing. &amp;nbsp;I had to install the .NET 4
framework, but that was being installed anyway by Visual Studio, so it
was already there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for packages was just as easy. &amp;nbsp;Their website is pretty
awesome and allows you to simply browse or search. &amp;nbsp;I found several of
my favorite tools, such as Notepad++, Cygwin, Sysinternals, VLC,
Greenshot, and several others there. &amp;nbsp;They even had a bunch of the
Microsoft Express tools there! Unlike APT, I still can't list a bunch of
packages on one line. &amp;nbsp;I can, however, do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
cinst package1; cinst package2; cinst package3
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is close enough. &amp;nbsp;It allows me to type in one line, hit enter, and
walk away. &amp;nbsp;Very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="well-what-is-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Well, What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's an integration framework written in Java. &amp;nbsp;In short, it's meant to
make the act of integrating systems together easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="enough-of-the-jibberish-wtfsck-is-an-integration-framework"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Enough of the Jibberish -- WTFsck() is an Integration Framework?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that line wouldn't have made much sense to me, either, before
reading the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Camel-Action-Claus-Ibsen/dp/1935182366/"&gt;Camel
book&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;It's probably best to refer to an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say you have some really annoying manual process that you use to
tie together two systems. &amp;nbsp;I had a previous employer who would create
ISO images and then had to manually upload them to a partner's site so
that they could mass-produce optical media from said image. &amp;nbsp;Some
person, who was not a seasoned FTP user (nor wanted to be) had to have a
set of credentials, access to the ISO, and had to babysit the upload.
&amp;nbsp;They also had the ability to break the transfer via FTP options. &amp;nbsp;In
this case, the partner needed us to use a specific set of options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that Camel could do easily. &amp;nbsp;Users create &amp;quot;routes&amp;quot; to
describe processes like the one above. &amp;nbsp;These routes can be described in
Java, XML, or one of the many DSLs (domain specific languages) that are
included. &amp;nbsp;Here's an example route in XML that could satisfy the above
problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;lt;route id=&amp;quot;publishIso&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;from uri=&amp;quot;file://path/to/iso/finished.iso&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;to uri=&amp;quot;ftp://user&amp;#64;ftp.partner.com/path/to/publish/duplicateMe.iso?password=superSecret&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/route&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This route can be embedded inside of a Spring config file. To launch the
route, the developer would just have to start a Spring context. This
would start Camel, which would read the XML file. It would then sit
there and scan the /path/to/iso/ directory for a filed named
finished.iso every 500ms (by default, as of the time of this writing).
When it finds the file, it will upload it to the specified FTP site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple, eh? All that from a little bit of XML and starting a Spring
context (all of less than 6 lines of code in Java).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="go-on"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Go on...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, as I stated, you can embed this into a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/spring.html"&gt;Spring
configuration&lt;/a&gt; file. Upon
starting the context, Camel will start. You can also describe routes
using the&amp;nbsp;Java &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/dsl.html"&gt;DSL&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
from(&amp;quot;file://path/to/iso/finished.iso&amp;quot;)
    .to(&amp;quot;ftp://user&amp;#64;ftp.partner.com/path/to/publish/duplicateMe.iso?password=superSecret&amp;quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; are described as
&amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/endpoint.html"&gt;Endpoints&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; in Camel.
&amp;nbsp;Endpoints are created by
&amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/component.html"&gt;Components&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;This simple
route demonstrates the File2 and FTP Components being used to generate
two Endpoints. &amp;nbsp;There are a TON of useful components, with this being a
list of the ones that I use most often:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/bean.html"&gt;Bean&lt;/a&gt; (for calling custom
beans)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/file2.html"&gt;File2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/jms.html"&gt;JMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="are-you-a-wizard"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Are you a Wizard?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. &amp;nbsp;But Camel is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It ties together these Endpoints by passing
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/maven/current/camel-core/apidocs/org/apache/camel/Message.html"&gt;Messages&lt;/a&gt;
to and fro. &amp;nbsp;In addition to being able to directly configure the
Endpoints, you can manipulate messages en route. &amp;nbsp;For instance, Camel
supports the notion of having &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/data-format.html"&gt;Data
Formats&lt;/a&gt; so that it can
seamlessly marshal/unmarshal a message body between Endpoints. &amp;nbsp;An
example use case might be if you're reading an XML file and you want to
call a custom bean that you wrote, passing in the XML as an object.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org/jaxb.html"&gt;Camel can use JAXB&lt;/a&gt; to populate
a POJO before calling your bean, preventing your custom bean from having
to know anything about the file itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also handles threading wizardry for you. &amp;nbsp;Many of these components
have multi-thread options, meaning that Camel handles the nasty
threading-bits. &amp;nbsp;It's still incumbent upon the user to make sure that
they're applying parallelism in an appropriate way, but Camel reduces
this exercise to one of configuration and not implementation; Camel's
bits already have this figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bottom-line"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camel saved me from having to implement a bunch of custom software to
tie together my systems. &amp;nbsp;I can create an XML config file, a few custom
beans if need be, and presto! &amp;nbsp;I now have Java program that will make
several systems play nice, threading, logging, and all. &amp;nbsp;Camel was a
tremendous find, and it's had a tremendous impact on my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kudos to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://apache.org"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;, the&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://camel.apache.org"&gt;Camel
project&lt;/a&gt;, and it's leader, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.davsclaus.com/"&gt;Claus

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I found myself bothered by how little I've put my

quite a bit, and then life came along and gave me an upper-cut. &amp;nbsp;So,
I've decided to go back to donating CPU time to scientific projects.
&amp;nbsp;I'm using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/"&gt;BOINC&lt;/a&gt; since it allows me to
donate to several projects at once and has a pretty awesome Linux
client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have spare CPU time floating around, I'd encourage you to do the
same!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.coldlight.com"&gt;Coldlight Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, a start-up in Wayne,
PA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've not written it here, but those who know me off-line know that I
would like to pursue a PhD at some point in my life. &amp;nbsp;I felt that moving
to Coldlight would put me closer to that goal. &amp;nbsp;Nothing against
Vanguard, but I felt that I wasn't growing that much there. &amp;nbsp;Writing web
services are good and fun, but I was using versions of libraries that
were written for Java 1.4. &amp;nbsp;I wasn't using anything terribly interesting
outside of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.springsource.org/spring-framework"&gt;Spring&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, Spring isn't the answer to everything. &amp;nbsp;There are bigger
and much more interesting things than Spring in the Java world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coldlight does a lot of work with large data sets and machine learning,
which happens to be a fairly hot research topic. &amp;nbsp;I figured the move
would give me a chance to explore a lot of new technologies and to gain
some experience and insight into a possible PhD research topic. &amp;nbsp;The
move would also have me working with a PhD who could possibly help guide
me into my next transition. &amp;nbsp;After a few rounds of interviewing, I made
the switch: &amp;nbsp;I decided to move to Coldlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I've been right. &amp;nbsp;I've learned several new technologies, such as
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://aws.amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/"&gt;Hadoop&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I've started learning about
different machine learning algorithms by poring through different
implementations and papers. &amp;nbsp;Sure, I occasionally get bogged down in
busy-work and get overloaded. &amp;nbsp;Overall, though, I feel like I've been
growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an added bonus, I've been able to usher in some practices and
technologies of my own. &amp;nbsp;I've introduced my team to proper SVN usage,
Maven, some pretty cool Eclipse plugins, and a few other things. &amp;nbsp;I'm
directly responsible for some of our process improvement initiatives and
for automating some of our development headaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feels good, man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided a while back that it'd be cool to do some graph analysis on
the English Wikipedia database. &amp;nbsp;I want to study how &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; the
articles are. &amp;nbsp;I also want to collect some statistics about the text of
the articles themselves, their references, and some …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;...but I did it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided a while back that it'd be cool to do some graph analysis on
the English Wikipedia database. &amp;nbsp;I want to study how &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; the
articles are. &amp;nbsp;I also want to collect some statistics about the text of
the articles themselves, their references, and some other fun numbers.
&amp;nbsp;At first glance, Wikipedia makes this easy. &amp;nbsp;WikiMedia (the group
behind Wikipedia) &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dumps.wikimedia.org/"&gt;publishes their database
dumps&lt;/a&gt; so that others can download
entire copies of any Wikipedia site in any language. &amp;nbsp;All of the dumps
provided are SQL dumps, with one big exception: &amp;nbsp;the page text. &amp;nbsp;In
order to maintain backward and forward compatibility, MediaWiki began
producing XML dumps a while back. &amp;nbsp;This XML file can be used to generate
the whole database, but to do so would mean that a Wiki engine would
have to scan and evaluate the text of every single article in order to
build some of the relationship tables. &amp;nbsp;Ew. &amp;nbsp;Luckily, MediaWiki provides
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:MWDumper"&gt;a tool for parsing this
data&lt;/a&gt;, so easy-peasy,
right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="first-challenge-huge-sql-dumps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First Challenge: &amp;nbsp;Huge SQL Dumps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let's handle the easy part first. &amp;nbsp;I downloaded a full dump and spun
up a virtual machine in Xen to handle the processing. &amp;nbsp;Since MySQL is
good enough to run Wikipedia, I figured that it was good enough for me,
too. &amp;nbsp;For the sake of completeness, I did not start with a blank
database. &amp;nbsp;I downloaded a copy of MediaWiki 1.9 and used the included
SQL script (maintenance/tables.sql) to create a blank MediaWiki
database. &amp;nbsp;Being lazy, I started running commands like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
zcat some_huge_file.sql.gz | mysql -u me -p en_wikipedia
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't get me wrong: that would work...if you wanted to wait several
years. &amp;nbsp;Why was it so slow? &amp;nbsp;Well, the dumps provided aren't wrapped in
a transaction or anything like that, so the database reindexes after
each &lt;em&gt;individual **insert.**&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; Slow is an understatement. &amp;nbsp;To fix this,
I wrote and zipped two small SQL scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;preimport.sql&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
SET autocommit=0;
SET unique_checks=0;
SET foreign_key_checks=0;
BEGIN;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;postimport.sql&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
COMMIT;
SET autocommit=1;
SET unique_checks=1;
SET foreign_key_checks=1;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what's going on here? &amp;nbsp;On preimport.sql, the first line is pretty
self&amp;nbsp;explanatory: &amp;nbsp;I don't want my queries
to&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/commit.html"&gt;auto-commit&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Rather, I want to chose when and if they are committed. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, I
wanted to disable
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_unique_checks"&gt;unique_checks&lt;/a&gt;
during the import. &amp;nbsp;I was using MyISAM tables, so this doesn't do much
for me, but those of you out there who may want to use InnoDB tables
will benefit greatly from this. &amp;nbsp;Likewise, I next disable
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_foreign_key_checks"&gt;foreign_key_checks&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Lastly, I use the BEGIN key word to start a transaction. &amp;nbsp;This will
prevent MySQL from calculating indexes until the entire data set has
been read. &amp;nbsp;As you can see, postimport is just the exact opposite of
preimport. &amp;nbsp;I also mentioned that I zipped them. &amp;nbsp;Why? &amp;nbsp;So I could do
this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
zcat preimport.sql.gz some_huge_file.sql.gz postimport.sql.gz | mysql -u me -p en_wikipedia
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That statement will, all in the same MySQL session, read the contents of
preimport.sql, the huge SQL file, and then postimport.sql. &amp;nbsp;If you're
cool, you can even wrap that whole mess with the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/01/time-command-examples/"&gt;*time*&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;command
so that you can get an exact time of how long it takes to run each
import. &amp;nbsp;All in all, most of my imports ran in only a few hours. &amp;nbsp;On on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="second-challenge-that-huge-xml-file"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Second Challenge: &amp;nbsp;That Huge XML File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By this point, we have just about all of the metadata we could want.
&amp;nbsp;What about the real stuff? &amp;nbsp;You know -- the content? &amp;nbsp;Oh yes, that!
&amp;nbsp;Well, that's where things get a bit sticky. &amp;nbsp;There 3 common options
that I've found for importing the data from the
enwiki-sometimestamp-pages-articles.xml.bz2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;importDump.php&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;xml2sql&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mwdumper&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;importDump.php is a tool built into MediaWiki. &amp;nbsp;It can produce an entire
database from one of these XML dumps. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, it's really slow.
&amp;nbsp;It's not recommended for use on larger data sets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xml2sql is an ANSI C program can can extract page and text information,
but not any of the metadata. &amp;nbsp;It's currently not maintained and it's not
officially supported by MediaWiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mwdumper is the official MediaWiki tool. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, it's not well
supported, either, but it turned out to be my best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to read the XML dump, I went with mwdumper since it's the
official tool and it's written in a language that I'm quite dangerous
with. &amp;nbsp;The first thing to note is that the most up-to-date version is
not available as a binary. &amp;nbsp;I had to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/mwdumper/"&gt;download the
source&lt;/a&gt;
and build it myself. &amp;nbsp;If you're familiar with the SVN-Maven-Java stack
(or you use &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts"&gt;STS&lt;/a&gt;) then
this is pretty simple and straight-forward. &amp;nbsp;I'm not going to cover how
to build the software here. &amp;nbsp;I assume that either the reader is able to
do this already or that there are instructions for doing so on the
project's page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I was able to produce an executable JAR, I bumped into three
problems. &amp;nbsp;The first one involves the file's format. The file that
MediaWiki produces is a valid bzip file, but for whatever reason,
mwdumper does not recognize it as such. &amp;nbsp;You can either unzip it first,
or use a pipe. &amp;nbsp;I wasn't very creative, so I first unzipped it, and then
ran this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
java -server -jar ../mwdumper-1.16-jar-with-dependencies.jar --format=sql:1.5 temp2.xml | gzip -vc &amp;gt; enwiki-latest-pages-articles.sql.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where temp2.xml was the unzipped version of the XML dump, and
enwiki-latest-pages-articles.sql.gz is where I want the SQL script to
go. This command will process the XML and convert it into SQL INSERT
statements and then pipe it through gzip so that your output stays
small(er). &amp;nbsp;When mwdumper is finished, we'll have a zipped SQL file that
we can handle just like we did the others in Step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is that some of the queries are larger than my MySQL
server would allow for. &amp;nbsp;To handle this, I had to modify my
/etc/mysql/my.cnf (on Ubuntu) file and change this setting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
max_allowed_packet = 128M
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setting controls the maximum size of a query that the server can
receive. By default, this value is rather small. Since we'll be
importing rows that contain whole articles, this value must be raised.
The value above should work just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third and last problem is that mwdumper would come to a grinding
halt a little over 4 million records in. &amp;nbsp;It would throw a strange error
about UTF-8 encoding. &amp;nbsp;I didn't see anything wrong, and I didn't have
any reason to believe that the file wasn't being encoded correctly, so I
inspected the first few lines of the file and found that there was no
XML declaration. &amp;nbsp;It appears that mwdumper assumed that it was UTF-8, so
I decided to add the following header:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;ISO-8859-1&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a common encoding for western European languages. There might
have been characters that got mangled in the process, but I wasn't
terribly worried about the occasional character here-and-there. If you
are, then you'll need to find your own workaround for this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once these 3 issues are cleared, then mwdumper will be able to produce
usable SQL that you can import. If you use the command that I provided
in step 1, you'll end up with a gzipped sql file that can be used just
like any of the other compressed SQL files in step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having this information up-front was a huge pain in the butt. I'm
also still not sure about the UTF-8 encoding issue. In retrospect, I
really don't know if the file was correctly encoded or not. At some
point, I'd like to automate this process so that imports aren't such a
hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Bloch&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Bottom line up
front: &amp;nbsp;totally worth the read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="format"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book's format is interesting. &amp;nbsp;At first, I wasn't sure if I liked
it, but it grew on me. &amp;nbsp;The book is divided into 78 items, each one
detailing arguments for an idiom or principle. &amp;nbsp;Many times, these items
reference each other, especially when in the same group. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes this
lends itself to the temptation to skip ahead to one of the mentioned
items, but I managed to resist. &amp;nbsp;It's interesting to see how some of the
items at the very end of the book related back to ones at the very
beginning. &amp;nbsp;Forcing myself to wait to read about some of the related
items gave me time to reflect on the item at hand and to kind of put it
in the back of my mind before moving forward. &amp;nbsp;As I came across
references to earlier items, I found that the earlier items made much
more sense. &amp;nbsp;Not that they didn't make sense before, but sometimes Bloch
would write a line or two that referenced items that I hadn't covered
yet. &amp;nbsp;All of the sudden, those extra few lines here and there started
making a lot more sense. &amp;nbsp;I think he did a very good job at linking
items while allowing them to stand separate. &amp;nbsp;I didn't have to skip
ahead to understand the item at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code used in the book is often reused when possible from item to
item. &amp;nbsp;This makes it even easier to link common items together. &amp;nbsp;Because
I was already familiar with the code, I could understand why parts of it
were structured a certain way, which allowed me to focus more on the
idiom at hand. &amp;nbsp;Often in programming books, example are written to
illustrate a point in such an oversimplified fashion that they end up
violating principles earlier in the book to demonstrate the current
topic or they end up not offering enough code for a full demonstration.
&amp;nbsp;Bloch does a really good job of avoiding this. &amp;nbsp;If he demonstrates a
principle that overlaps with another one, he'll write the code such that
it adheres to both and note it accordingly. &amp;nbsp;I also like that each
principle comes with some &amp;quot;good code, bad code&amp;quot; examples. &amp;nbsp;While reading
through some of these, I couldn't help but to be reminded of &amp;quot;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8PhzrmBgMI"&gt;Good
Idea, Bad Idea&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; from
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs"&gt;Animaniacs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="structure-of-arguments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Structure of Arguments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't remember the last time I read a book when an author provided so
much balance to their arguments. &amp;nbsp;Granted, sometimes Bloch did strongly
advocate for or against something. &amp;nbsp;In most of those cases (I say most
because I don't have enough background knowledge to make judgements on
some of them), they were warranted. &amp;nbsp;Often, each argument came with a
list of times when they were appropriate and when they were to be
avoided. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes, simple litmus-test type questions were given in
order to aid a developer in figuring out when a principle applies. &amp;nbsp;To
me, this was *the* most important content of the book. &amp;nbsp;Some of the
principles have obvious applications, but others were more obscure. &amp;nbsp;The
list of principles does me know good if I cannot make an intelligent
argument for or against one when developing a system. &amp;nbsp;I now have simple
questions that I can ask myself or others to help determine what
patterns or idioms are appropriate to apply to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="citations"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't read an item without seeing several citations. &amp;nbsp;Looking at the
list of sources in the book's appendix gives the reader a sense of just
how much work and knowledge went into creating this book. &amp;nbsp;His sources
run the gamut, from items as low level as the Java specification itself
all the way up to citing himself and other best-practice authors. &amp;nbsp;This
gives the reader the tools to go deeper should they choose to. &amp;nbsp;Want to
know why certain features of the language aren't guaranteed? &amp;nbsp;Go read
spec-X! &amp;nbsp;Want to be a multi-threading wizard? &amp;nbsp;Go read guide-Y! &amp;nbsp;As a
result of this book, my next purchase will be the book that he cites on
multithreading topics (I don't remember the title off-hand). &amp;nbsp;I'm also
now curious to try my hand at going through some of the language specs.
&amp;nbsp;Way to spark interest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="final-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this book is no bible, it was effective immediately. &amp;nbsp;I was able
to easily apply some of these principles to my work and open source
programming efforts. &amp;nbsp;I feel like I have a much deeper understanding of
the language and how certain programming errors start and propagate
themselves. &amp;nbsp;I've thought of type safety issues before, but the book
took this sentiment a step further by getting me into the habit of
structuring my code so that more errors are caught at compile-time.
&amp;nbsp;This has been a great lesson in syntax, patterns, and quality
assurance. &amp;nbsp;I will be reading this book again -- it was full of gems,
and I'm eager to go back a second time and to see what else dawns on me.&lt;/p&gt;

(movies, music, etc) from my Ubuntu &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)"&gt;SMB
server&lt;/a&gt; to my TV. &amp;nbsp;Now
that I own a TV capable of high-def, I wanted more. &amp;nbsp;I also wanted to
lower my cable bill. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, XBMC does not directly support
premium video services like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.netflix.com"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Further more, the 3rd party Netflix plugins won't work for XBMC if
you're not running on a Windows or OSX machine due to the lack of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight"&gt;MS
Silverlight&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I
decided it was time to switch -- I want a device that can stream from
premium sources AND my local network. &amp;nbsp;Enter the Boxee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-boxee"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;nbsp;Why Boxee?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing was definitely the network media streaming. &amp;nbsp;Very few
of the media center appliances have this. &amp;nbsp;I have a file server that's
full of my (legal, of course) music, movies, and TV shows that I've
acquired over the years. &amp;nbsp;I want to be able to watch those on my TV,
too. Plus, I shouldn't have to fire up my computer just to play a few
MP3s through my stereo. &amp;nbsp;If I'm going to buy something to play media to
my TV, it better handle local network media, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second biggest thing was Netflix. &amp;nbsp;I wanted to replace my cable with
something that I wouldn't get bored of. &amp;nbsp;I used to share a Netflix
account with a friend. &amp;nbsp;I remember being blown away with the selection
and quality of the media they offered. &amp;nbsp;The Netflix part of the decision
was a no brainer: &amp;nbsp;it was mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, I own a high-def TV. &amp;nbsp;I wanted something that could handle
high-def resolutions. &amp;nbsp;Even if Netflix isn't full hd, it might be some
day. &amp;nbsp;Also, some of my local network content is high-def. &amp;nbsp;Not that I'm
picky about connectors, but having a box that uses
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI"&gt;HDMI&lt;/a&gt; makes life easy. One plug
to rule them all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-to-love"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's to Love?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm glad you asked! &amp;nbsp;First and foremost, the Netflix app is pretty
awesome. &amp;nbsp;It's not given me any stability issues, it's easy to use with
the remote, and the picture looks great. &amp;nbsp;Setup was a breeze. &amp;nbsp;The first
time you power it on, you're prompted to sign into a wifi network,
configure the output resolution, and a few other things. &amp;nbsp;I also like
that I get recommended content in my home screen. &amp;nbsp;As of now, it's just
free content from YouTube and a few other sources. &amp;nbsp;I'd like to see if I
can modify that, but for now it's fun. &amp;nbsp;I end up finding some really
cool short movies whenever I go flipping through the home feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remote is pretty awesome. &amp;nbsp;On one side, it's a directional pad with
a select and back button. &amp;nbsp;On the other side, it's a QWERTY keyboard.
&amp;nbsp;The keyboard is really cool for searching for content. &amp;nbsp;My friend Tim
used to launch Netflix through his Wii, and typing anything of length by
using the Wiimote was a pain. &amp;nbsp;The keyboard is a cool feature. &amp;nbsp;In
addition to the remote, there's also a built-in web server. &amp;nbsp;The web
server does't put out human-readable web pages, but it does allow for
3rd party apps to control the Boxee. &amp;nbsp;For my Android phone, I found an
app called Boxee Thumb. &amp;nbsp;Basically, it auto-detects the Boxee (if you're
connected to the same network) and allows you to use swipe gestures,
soft buttons, or your phone's keyboard to control the unit. &amp;nbsp;The swipe
gestures are pretty cool -- I enjoy being able to swipe through play
lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Boxee also allows for 3rd party software. &amp;nbsp;The default software
channel has 200+ apps. &amp;nbsp;You have the ability to add additional
repositories, which provide additional software. &amp;nbsp;I have yet to try any
third party channels, but I'm looking. &amp;nbsp;You can also write your own apps
and either load them onto a channel or onto a USB stick and run them
locally. &amp;nbsp;The interface is done by using HTML5/CSS3. &amp;nbsp;Python is used to
access the Boxee's functionality and can be embedded right into the HTML
to provide access to system functions. &amp;nbsp;Pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-to-hate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's to Hate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot, unfortunately. &amp;nbsp;The Boxee has a ton of great features, but
they're offset by the interface. &amp;nbsp;It simply sucks. &amp;nbsp;Most of my negative
opinion centers around the interface's instability. &amp;nbsp;If I stay in an
app, everything's golden. &amp;nbsp;As soon as I start switching apps and
switching windows, the Boxee will freeze and need a hard reset. &amp;nbsp;What a
pain! &amp;nbsp;If my phone crashed &amp;nbsp;that often, I'd throw it at someone.
&amp;nbsp;Fortunately, I don't venture from app-to-app too often, so it's
tolerable, but leaves a bad taste in my mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some parts of the interface are also rather ugly. &amp;nbsp;Local media browsing
is one of those places. &amp;nbsp;When it works right, it looks nice and is able
to pull episode, movie, and track information from the web. &amp;nbsp;When it
doesn't work, it's a pain. &amp;nbsp;Manual resolution sucks. &amp;nbsp;Some of it is my
fault for not having things properly labeled, but I should be given a
better interface (perhaps web?) for fixing unidentified media. &amp;nbsp;Also,
scanning of network (in this case, SMB) shares causes a noticeable lag.
&amp;nbsp;I'd rather have a slower scan that doesn't bring down the system than
to have a faster scan that doesn't share the CPU well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate to say it, but the box itself is almost as ugly as some of the UI
components. &amp;nbsp;I don't think it's attractive at all. &amp;nbsp;Instead of rounding
corners, I simply have one sliced off. &amp;nbsp;The appearance is awkward at
best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="overall"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overall&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing's saving grace is all of the codecs and external media
features. &amp;nbsp;Overall, I'd give it a 3.75/5 stars. &amp;nbsp;The interface gets a
2/5 for sucking so bad, and the feature set gets a 5/5 for being so rich
and complete. &amp;nbsp;I would recommend this unit for those who are more tech
savvy, have more advanced needs, or are simply patient and are willing
to wait for these things to be fixed via updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

more interesting as well we are finally getting closer to a new web

it's been an amazing year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just this past week, I've managed to really live up my last bits of
2011. &amp;nbsp;During the last week of December, I went to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://longwoodgardens.org"&gt;Longwood
Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to check out their night time
light display. &amp;nbsp;It was worth dealing with the cold (it got down to 26F
that night) to see their winter time display. &amp;nbsp;The last time I was at
Longwood was during the day. &amp;nbsp;There were some parts that I liked better
in the daylight, but the night time was still really impressive. &amp;nbsp;To be
honest, I think Longwood is much more worth visiting at night. &amp;nbsp;One of
the best parts was a fountain display near the entrance into the
gardens. &amp;nbsp;All of the water jets had lights under them that would change
color as the music played on. &amp;nbsp;The jets alone made for an interesting
show, but the lights definitely made it much more captivating. &amp;nbsp;That
alone was worth dealing with the night time cold. &amp;nbsp;To help beat the
cold, I spend some time hiding in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.longwoodgardens.org/TheCafe.html"&gt;the
Cafe&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It was a little
bit expensive, but the food was good and they had beer (how could you go
wrong?!). &amp;nbsp;Though it has a very cafeteria look, the food was definitely
not cafeteria quality. &amp;nbsp;I'm kind of sorry that I didn't find that
sooner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll skip over the part about the New Year's Eve party and leave that
for the people who are on my Facebook :).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Year's Day was really special this year. &amp;nbsp;I've lived in Philadelphia
for most of my life, but I had never seen the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mummers_Parade"&gt;Mummers
Parade&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Well, that
changed. &amp;nbsp;I spent a few hours of this year hanging out on Broad Street
and watching the show. &amp;nbsp;I don't think I've ever been this fascinated
with costumes before -- there's just something about watching a bunch of
men dressed like women march around while playing the banjo! &amp;nbsp;Today was
a perfect day for it -- it was in the high 4o's/low 50's, sunny, and
relatively calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that 2011's over, I have a lot to look forward to in 2012. &amp;nbsp;For
starters, I've been asked to resume my work on 0 A.D.'s website. &amp;nbsp;I've
also started work on finding a way to use 0 A.D. in computer science
education for high schoolers (more on that later). &amp;nbsp;The big change this
year is the new job, but I'll leave that for another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy 2012!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I recently sold a bunch of stuff on eBay (as I &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2011/09/26/selling-stuff-on-ebay/"&gt;previously

&lt;h2&gt;Bg&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I recently sold a bunch of stuff on eBay (as I &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2011/09/26/selling-stuff-on-ebay/"&gt;previously
mentioned&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;I then used that
money to buy a new server. &amp;nbsp;For the sake of making this article easier
to find, here's what I bought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rackable Systems C2004 with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intel S5000PSL mother board&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 x 2.66 dual core Xeon processors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea was to load up this server with RAM (it'll take 32Gb) and hard
drives (4 x 2Tb SATA II) so that I could replace all of my other
servers. &amp;nbsp;This machine has plenty of horse power for performing my GIS
work and for reducing my server count via virtualization. &amp;nbsp;So, like I do
with all servers, I went to install Ubuntu Linux. &amp;nbsp;This is where the fun
ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="trying-to-set-up-the-server"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trying to Set-up the Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will spare you some of the details, but I ended up trying to install
Ubuntu via a USB thumb drive and a good 'ol IDE CD-ROM drive. &amp;nbsp;Every
time I ran the installer (for 10.04.3 and 11.04), the install worked.
&amp;nbsp;Everything appeared to be set up without a hitch Great, wonderful,
weee! &amp;nbsp;And then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="good-luck-booting-bro"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Good Luck Booting, Bro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wouldn't boot. &amp;nbsp;No matter how I did my install, with or without LVM,
with or without EXT4, with or without&amp;nbsp;sacrificing&amp;nbsp;goats, it just
wouldn't boot. &amp;nbsp;I would just get a black screen with nothing more than a
single blinking cursor. &amp;nbsp;It wouldn't respond to keyboard input, yelling,
or ritualistic dances. &amp;nbsp; Booting the install media in rescue mode showed
that the logs were empty. &amp;nbsp;Clearly, I have a hardware problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I started monkeying around with BIOS settings. &amp;nbsp;I made sure
my on-board (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto"&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt;)
RAID was disabled, that all of the settings were reasonable, and that I
didn't have anything strange turned on. &amp;nbsp;No dice. &amp;nbsp;After days of
troubleshooting, I started hitting the forums. &amp;nbsp;One suggested that if I
don't get a GRUB screen at all that it was a GRUB problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="fixing-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was that I was using GRUB2. &amp;nbsp;For some reason, it just didn't
play nice with my mobo. &amp;nbsp;So, I booted into rescue mode and executed a
shell in my root partition and ran this (Because I was in a rescue
terminal, I was already root. &amp;nbsp;If you're not root, you must prefix these
with sudo):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;apt-get remove grub-pc&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;apt-get install grub&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;grub-install /dev/sda&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;update-grub&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magic! &amp;nbsp;It booted! &amp;nbsp;Hopefully this saves someone a headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Unfortunately, this means some of my projects have slipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the haunt is over (we go back to weekend shows after October), I'll
be resuming my work. Looking at my list of blog posts reminds me that I
have a lot to do and write about. I've been making some good progress on
my GIS work, but I have other things to pick up. I also want to work on
some 0AD stuff, resume work on my on-line D&amp;amp;D character sheet app, and I
have another project that I'm not willing to talk about yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully coming back to some of my projects after the haunt will give
me some new ideas or motivation. &amp;nbsp;I've lacked quite a bit of coding
motivation for the last several months (probably because I code all day
at work), so I'm hoping this little break will kick-start things for me
and help me get excited to get back to work.&lt;/p&gt;

old tech stuff that I have been holding onto for quite some time. &amp;nbsp;The
majority of it was still in good working order, which is why I was so
hesitant to let it go. &amp;nbsp;Instead of throwing it all away or keeping it in
my closet, I decided to&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://myworld.ebay.com/bstempi"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt; a
bunch of it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, it's been quite the pleasant experience. &amp;nbsp;I've sold an item
on eBay before, but this was my first time selling a ton of crap.
&amp;nbsp;Posting the items was easy once I had taken a few pictures. &amp;nbsp;Getting
messages and notifications was easy using the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mobile.ebay.com/android/ebay-on-android"&gt;eBay Android
app&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Shipping was
easy because most of my items were small, so I just defaulted to using
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.usps.com/"&gt;USPS&lt;/a&gt; flat rate boxes (especially since
the boxes were free!). &amp;nbsp;The USPS allows you to print out your own labels
and to save a few cents (which add up) for not making them do it in
their retail locations. &amp;nbsp;Once I had everything packed and labeled, I
just had to walk it down to the Post Office, which is all of 5 minutes
away, drop it off, and use my eBay app to mark the items as shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I got the hang of the process, it became pretty fun. &amp;nbsp;There are
some other things I'm trying to get rid of, so I'll be selling for a
while. &amp;nbsp;eBay even gave me a gold star!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: &amp;nbsp;I don't think the program is improving. &amp;nbsp;It improved
wonderfully for my first year or two, and then went stagnant. &amp;nbsp;To be a
little more clear, the circumstances have improved (volunteers, outside
involvement, etc), but the program (the impact we have on the kids, how
well we treat our students and alum, our ability to organize) has not.
&amp;nbsp;I believe that our&amp;nbsp;curriculum&amp;nbsp;changes are going to wound the program
and undo the last few years of work that we've (myself, the other
volunteers, officers, and others who've contributed) put in. &amp;nbsp;Quite
frankly, I think the curriculum is nothing short of embarrassing.
&amp;nbsp;Giving up almost every Saturday for 6 months at a time without any
call-outs or mishaps is not easy or comfortable. &amp;nbsp;It's a
welcome&amp;nbsp;sacrifice&amp;nbsp;when it's making an impact and when things are getting
better. &amp;nbsp;I no longer think that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="so-stop-being-a-wuss-and-change-the-curriculum"&gt;

&lt;div class="line"&gt;No!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I'm supposed to be part of a team. &amp;nbsp;That means that I'm supposed to
trust others and that others are supposed to trust me so that we can
achieve maximum cooperation. &amp;nbsp;I can't give up every Saturday, be one
of the central hubs of communication, and undo everyone's mistakes. &amp;nbsp;I
have to trust that my team mates, my partners in crime, will fill in
and do what they're supposed to do. &amp;nbsp;After seeing what has gone into
that curriculum, which was written by a Java programmer and adjusted
by a professor with a masters degree in education, I've lost that
trust. &amp;nbsp;It was that awful.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without actually showing the document, which I think would be unethical,
it lays out a plan for teaching Java, HTML, CSS, JSP, SQL, cyber
security, mobile apps, and their respective tools (Eclipse, MySql admin
tools, etc etc words words words) in less than one calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let that settle in for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking at the 2011 HSCC programming problem, I thought to myself:
&amp;quot;Self, this problem is probably difficult for a lot of the kids that I
went to Temple with.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;The problem's not hard because it's a difficult
problem. &amp;nbsp;It just uses a ton of different technologies that the kids
have to be competent in and have to be able to orchestrate together. &amp;nbsp;In
order for students to troubleshoot their own compilation and run-time
issues, they need to have a good handle on all of those different
layers. &amp;nbsp;They have to understand the non-obvious things. &amp;nbsp;That simply
takes time. &amp;nbsp;To get to the point where someone could do this type of
project at Temple, one had to take 8+ computer science related classes.
&amp;nbsp;That means that if you were a college student, you'd have to pack (and
possibly overload) 2 full semesters of nothing but computer stuff to get
there. &amp;nbsp;Even if someone did this, you can probably guess why they'd have
a hard time. &amp;nbsp;Some of those classes happen in sequence for a reason --
you need to gain understanding in one so that it can be applied to
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;everything in one year&amp;quot; approach is simply unreasonable and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-the-public-announcement"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the Public Announcement?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this is a big deal to me. &amp;nbsp;I've poured a lot of
heart into this program. &amp;nbsp;This is not being taken lightly at all. &amp;nbsp;If
I'm going to go through the trouble of separation, then I need to have
it clearly stated why. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, I want kids who participated to know.
&amp;nbsp;It's a tough choice for me -- I almost feel like I'm abandoning them.
&amp;nbsp;I want them to know that I refuse to waste their time on something that
I think is not going to benefit them. &amp;nbsp;I want to have an impact on them.
&amp;nbsp;Thirdly, I hope that other chapters and members see this and get
something from it. &amp;nbsp;Even if people disagree with my actions and my
reasons, I hope that I've caused people to take a look at their values
and goals related to this program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I wish everyone involved the best and hope that they all
prove me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

managed to very quickly get a Minecraft server running on my mapping

wants to be able to do some cool things with videos, images, music, and
more. Games are all about media, and any good game website has to do a
good job at showcasing their media. After all, what good is the website
if it doesn't good a good job at showcasing the game (not the one you
just lost, either)? One of the first major customization that I wanted
to make for their new website was to handle videos in a way that allowed
for them to be showcased and to do so with minimal maintenance. We're
all volunteers, so we need to take maintenance effort seriously. I
decided to experiment with writing a
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Writing_a_Plugin"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; plugin that
would handle their video management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="youtube-api"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;YouTube API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, I thought that I would leverage something that we
already use: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/play0ad"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. We have a
channel, and YT had the ability to organize videos into channels and to
add tagging, ratings, comments, etc. Why not leverage those and find a
way to consume them on our website? After doing a little bit of
Google'ing, I found that &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.gdata.youtube.html"&gt;Zend produces a YouTube API for
PHP&lt;/a&gt;.
Awesome! That takes a lot of the guess work out of understanding how to
form URLs, parse arguments, and all of the nasty string stuff that comes
along with calling a web API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the API was really easy. It only took a few lines of code to get
the API to work with my test app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
require_once 'Zend/Loader.php'; Zend_Loader::loadClass('Zend_Gdata_YouTube'); $yt = new Zend_Gdata_YouTube(); $yt-&amp;gt;setMajorProtocolVersion(2);
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, getting a feed from a user is really easy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
$videoFeed = $yt-&amp;gt;getUserUploads('play0ad');
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looping through the results and printing the result of the feed is
slightly more code, but still not tough by any means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
function printVideoFeed($videoFeed) {

    foreach ($videoFeed as $videoEntry) {
        // the videoEntry object contains many helper functions
        // that access the underlying mediaGroup object
        echo 'Video: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoTitle() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Video ID: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoId() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Updated: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getUpdated() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Description: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoDescription() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Category: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoCategory() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Tags: ' . implode(&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;, $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoTags()) . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Watch page: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoWatchPageUrl() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Flash Player Url: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getFlashPlayerUrl() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Duration: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoDuration() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'View count: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoViewCount() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Rating: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoRatingInfo() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Geo Location: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoGeoLocation() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        echo 'Recorded on: ' . $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoRecorded() . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;

        // see the paragraph above this function for more information on the
        // 'mediaGroup' object. in the following code, we use the mediaGroup
        // object directly to retrieve its 'Mobile RSTP link' child
        foreach ($videoEntry-&amp;gt;mediaGroup-&amp;gt;content as $content) {
            if ($content-&amp;gt;type === &amp;quot;video/3gpp&amp;quot;) {
                echo 'Mobile RTSP link: ' . $content-&amp;gt;url . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
            }
        }

        echo &amp;quot;Thumbnails:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
        $videoThumbnails = $videoEntry-&amp;gt;getVideoThumbnails();

        foreach($videoThumbnails as $videoThumbnail) {
            echo $videoThumbnail['time'] . ' - ' . $videoThumbnail['url'];
            echo ' height=' . $videoThumbnail['height'];
            echo ' width=' . $videoThumbnail['width'] . &amp;quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;quot;;
            echo '&amp;lt;img src=&amp;quot;' . $videoThumbnail['url'] .'&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;';
            echo '&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;';
        }
        echo '&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;';
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll have to excuse the poor code formatting...I couldn't get it to
look nice in WP. &amp;nbsp;Oh well. &amp;nbsp;Anyways, that's a lot of power with only a
little bit of code! &amp;nbsp;You can also pull user comments, ratings, and just
about anything else you could find right on YT. &amp;nbsp;Just imagine what I
could do with a plug-in. &amp;nbsp;I could allow a &amp;quot;media manager&amp;quot; to specially
tag videos for front page display or with special tags of some sort that
dictate which pages those videos display on within the WFG site. &amp;nbsp;The
way those tags are interpreted could be handled within WP through an
admin plug-in configuration panel. &amp;nbsp;Someone could choose where a certain
&amp;quot;class&amp;quot; of video (video found on a certain channel, perhaps with a
certain tag) would be displayed by embedding a special tag within the
target page. &amp;nbsp;We could do a lot with a little!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="doing-more"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Doing More&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WFG also wants user videos. &amp;nbsp;Our users are our supporters and our
motivation. &amp;nbsp;While searching around, I found a Google App Engine app
called &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.youtube.com/direct"&gt;YouTube Direct&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The idea is
that a website can embed a snippet of code on their page to&amp;nbsp;elicit
videos for a contest. &amp;nbsp;Each such portal would be associated with a
contest. &amp;nbsp;When a user clicks on that entry bit, they will be prompted to
log into YouTube and to either select a current video or to upload a new
one. &amp;nbsp;Once a video is identified or uploaded, it will be added to a
queue for contest admins to look at. &amp;nbsp;Note that the video lives on the
user's account and that they still own it...the video itself doesn't
actually sit in a queue. &amp;nbsp;Admins can accept or reject videos, leave
comments and ratings, and a few other things that would reside within
the app. &amp;nbsp;Once videos are accepted, they're added to a channel on the
host account (the one running the contests) for all to see. &amp;nbsp;Once again,
this is key because it's pretty low maintenance, utilizes free resources
or resources that we already have, and adds a lot of value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, I'm pretty impressed with what I can do with a few lines of
code and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/bstempi/0ad-youtube-channel-for-wordpress/wiki/Home"&gt;started my plugin
development&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;I've been adding code as I've been able to. &amp;nbsp;It's slow, but moving. &amp;nbsp;I
get to add code once per week or every other week, which is slower than
I'd like, but at least I'm moving along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

to download MNDOT traffic data (mentioned in a &lt;a class="reference external" href="/2011/04/09/321/"&gt;previous
post&lt;/a&gt;), but I decided to switch things up a bit. &amp;nbsp;I
decided to throw away my old database and to get new data. &amp;nbsp;I decided
that this was a good idea because I'm not sure how reproduceable my
results are. &amp;nbsp;I figured that I could probably find a better way to
import data in the process. &amp;nbsp;The way that I found isn't any better when
it comes to procedures since it's more difficult and takes much longer,
but it does give me &amp;quot;better data.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I was using osm2pgsql to import my data from an OSM file
(downloaded from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://cloudmade.com/"&gt;CouldMade&lt;/a&gt;) into my
database. &amp;nbsp;Then, I found &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql"&gt;this
article&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;The juicy
bit that made me face-palm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
osm2pgsql is a lossy conversion utility. It only adds features that
have certain tags, as defined in the config file, and it converts
nodes and ways to linestrings and polygons. This means that you
can't tell which linestring is connected to which, but for rendering
a map that's not important (as opposed to routing).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the crack?! &amp;nbsp;Routing is at the heart of what I do! &amp;nbsp;Wow -- what a
catch. &amp;nbsp;So, what next? &amp;nbsp;Well, I turned to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis"&gt;osmosis&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;This tool is
ugly and took forever, but it produces a schema that's almost identical
to OSMs. &amp;nbsp;The schema itself is worth the wait. &amp;nbsp;osmosis creates a table
called &lt;em&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt; that contains the majority of the data in the database.
&amp;nbsp;These nodes include tags, ids, versions, time stamps, and the point
itself. &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;What about the lines?&amp;quot; you might ask. &amp;nbsp;Well, there's a &lt;em&gt;ways&lt;/em&gt;
table. &amp;nbsp;This table contains an id, some tags, and an array of the nodes
listed in the line. &amp;nbsp;Hey, that's cool! &amp;nbsp;That sounds like the beginning
of a graph, which would be really useful. &amp;nbsp;Then, I found the
&lt;em&gt;way_nodes&lt;/em&gt; table, which is a graph. &amp;nbsp;It lists the wayId, nodeId, and
the sequence of that node within the way. &amp;nbsp;I spent a lot of time coming
up with that kind of stuff in my project! &amp;nbsp;This database won't be easy
to draw from, but it seems like it'd be perfect for the types of things
that I'm doing -- routing and graph operations. &amp;nbsp;So, what happens when I
draw it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.qgis.org"&gt;QGIS&lt;/a&gt; gives me the finger. &amp;nbsp;Yep. &amp;nbsp;My weapon of
choice for the last few years won't work for this database. &amp;nbsp;Due to the
number of nodes in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Planet.osm"&gt;planet.osm&lt;/a&gt; file (you
know -- THE BIG ONE), the database schema uses a BIGINT datatype for the
ids. &amp;nbsp;QGIS won't touch your database unless you use int4 datatypes for
the ids. &amp;nbsp;There's a ticket open about it, but it's been lingering for
quite some time. &amp;nbsp;So, I'm forced to use another desktop based tool. &amp;nbsp;I'm
currently trying &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://udig.refractions.net/"&gt;uDig&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I've only
been using it for all of 10 minutes, so I can't speak about it yet -- I
haven't had enough time to develop an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anywho, hopefully this eases my work and leads to some cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

such a long way since I joined the team back in July of 2010. &amp;nbsp;I don't

&lt;h2&gt;Sweet Moves, Brah&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat down tonight and played the AI (experimental) in a game. &amp;nbsp;I
haven't had that much fun in quite some time. &amp;nbsp;Despite being a simple
AI, it gave me a run for my money at first. &amp;nbsp;It definitely did a better
job at building with the initial resources. &amp;nbsp;It was also the first to
have an army and to attack. &amp;nbsp;I thought I was done for! &amp;nbsp;Fortunately for
me, it was pretty good at ignoring anything other than my town hall. &amp;nbsp;If
the AI sent soldiers to attack me, I could attack them while they were
in transit without fear of retaliation. &amp;nbsp;The didn't begin to attack
until they reached their objective: &amp;nbsp;my town hall. &amp;nbsp;Once I realized
that, I came pack for the pwn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="awesome-landscapes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Awesome Landscapes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty blown away by the graphics. &amp;nbsp;If you want to get a good look
at the units and buildings, you can mouse-wheel forward to zoom in. &amp;nbsp;The
units look great, the landscape is awesome, and the water effects are
really top-notch. &amp;nbsp;I've noticed a few graphics glitches here and there,
so it could definitely use some more polishing, but over all I'm really
impressed. &amp;nbsp;For some reason, the landscapes were the biggest thing to
catch my eye. &amp;nbsp;They look so much nicer than what I remember seeing in
any of the Age of Empires games (I think &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/ageofmythology/"&gt;Age of
Mythology&lt;/a&gt; was the
last one that I played).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-smoother"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Smoother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first tried the game back in July, I remember having a hard time
playing. &amp;nbsp;Part of it was my hardware, but I remember having a lot of
glitches and lag once I moved onto a different machine. &amp;nbsp;Since then,
things seemed to have gotten much better. &amp;nbsp;There's still the occasional
glitch or lag here-and-there, but it doesn't really take that much away
from the game play. &amp;nbsp;Don't get me wrong -- I found a few things that I
found a little frustrating. &amp;nbsp;The fun definitely out-weighs the
frustration, though. &amp;nbsp;I was pretty impressed&amp;nbsp;once I started using the
rotate and zoom features while I was micro-managing some of my units.
&amp;nbsp;The zoom/rotate is really smooth and looks really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="get-to-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get to It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd highly recommend going and playing 0 A.D. &amp;nbsp;You can &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/page.php?p=14425"&gt;download the
game here&lt;/a&gt; and find
the forums here: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum"&gt;http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;While you're at
it: &amp;nbsp;make sure to enable the anonymous feedback. &amp;nbsp;It helps us know what
kind of graphics hardware our users are running, which helps us to make

organize, store, distribute all of my course content. &amp;nbsp;I've fallen in
love with it! &amp;nbsp;It can auto-grade my&amp;nbsp;quizzes, serve as a file repository,
allow the students to keep notes, and track student progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="praises"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Praises&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this year's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hscc.bdpaphilly.org"&gt;BDPA HSCC program&lt;/a&gt; has
started taking off, I started looking at Moodle 2.0 and found some
things that were quite attractive to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New default theme. &amp;nbsp;I like the new theme more than the old one. &amp;nbsp;The
menus are much easier to navigate and it has a nicer overall
appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New wiki plugin. &amp;nbsp;I started using a course to allow all of the
coordinators to communicate. &amp;nbsp;Within this course, I started a forum,
a wiki, and a few file folders. &amp;nbsp;Moodle 2.0's wiki is much nicer than
1.9's and allows for the use of Creole for creating and styling
content, which makes it easier for me to collaborate with my fellow
volunteers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New editor. &amp;nbsp;Moodle 1.9 used a text editor that didn't render in
Chrome without a manual patch. &amp;nbsp;Version 2.0 features the use of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/"&gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I've not only used
TinyMCE on other sites before, but I've also sites that utilize it.
&amp;nbsp;It's a nice piece that's been well integrated into Moodle. &amp;nbsp;The team
did a really nice job with making sure that TinyMCE can correctly
upload and display images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plus a bunch more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="criticisms"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Criticisms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've criticized the Moodle upgrade/update system, and I'll criticize it
again: &amp;nbsp;WordPress has a model to copy. &amp;nbsp;Moodle has taken some steps
forward by allowing for upgrades from the CLI, but it's still not
polished enough to allow me to try and throw away plugins. &amp;nbsp;It's too
much of a process to experiment with new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bottom-line"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the new version has been running really, really well. &amp;nbsp;The
upgrade was flawless and the site is performing just as well as it did
with 1.9. &amp;nbsp;Another successful upgrade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

work for WFG lately. &amp;nbsp;Our messaging board system and some other parts of
our website run on the Invision Power Board version 2. &amp;nbsp;We'd happily
keep chugging along, but IBP2 is no longer supported, so we have to move
to IPB3 in order to keep getting updates and new features. &amp;nbsp;Since it's a
fairly large forum (more than 200,000 posts), I thought that I'd take
the opportunity to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for upgrading wasn't that bad. &amp;nbsp;All I had to do was to
upload some new files, run upgrade.php, and then log into the admin
panel and rebuild the posts. &amp;nbsp;Done! &amp;nbsp;Granted, the process took a while
(rebuilding posts take a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of DB time), but it didn't require that
much effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="benefits"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to sound like a sales pitch, but there were some very good
reasons for upgrading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates. &amp;nbsp;IPB2 was no longer maintained, so we weren't getting
security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spam control. &amp;nbsp;IPB2 didn't have any built-in measures for controlling
spam, but v3 does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ban-hammer. &amp;nbsp;IPB3 makes it much easier to patrol the forums and to
remove offensive posts or to warn users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editors. &amp;nbsp;The new version has a much nicer post editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="experience"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade was pretty easy...just upload a few files, run a PHP script,
and wa-la! &amp;nbsp;Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of the package that I was given, 3.1.3, contains an error.
&amp;nbsp;The error was found by one of our developers, Ykkrosh (Phillip):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Assuming this is about the formatting buttons in the post interface,
it looks like it fails when it tries processing the
&amp;quot;ed-0_palette_otherstyles_img center&amp;quot; element, because that name
contains a space and so it breaks the selector passed to
querySelectorAll since they don't escape it properly
('#ed-0_palette_otherstyles_img center input[type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;]'). (I
have no idea why they mess around with id selectors instead of just
calling Element.querySelectorAll directly). Given they have lots of
different selector implementations and it might take effort to fix
bugs in all of them, I guess the safer solution is to get rid of the
&amp;quot;img center&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;img left&amp;quot; etc custom BBcodes, since I think we
only use them for aligning images in the site content pages (which
don't use this forum any more).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This error caused all kinds of headaches. &amp;nbsp;The WYSIWYG editor for adding
and editing posts would display HTML tags instead of formatting the text
for you. &amp;nbsp;If you were leaving a reply, it would also clear the text
field if the field lost and then regained focus. &amp;nbsp;What a pain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT -- Everything post-upgrade has been pretty awesome. &amp;nbsp;We now have a
new theme, a &amp;quot;portal,&amp;quot; and a few other nice features. &amp;nbsp;Over all, it's
been a great success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-moar-you-know"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Moar You Know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did I take away from this? &amp;nbsp;A few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; test enough. &amp;nbsp;I ran through several test upgrades
on my hosting account to make sure that nothing was broken and
identified a few configuration bugs. &amp;nbsp;Some of the other team members
even submitted bug reports, which made me feel good -- I'd rather
find stuff in testing than after deployment. &amp;nbsp;Yet, somehow we all
neglected to actually try to post :p. &amp;nbsp;There were some simple and
crucial tests that I could have run to prevent the few days of
headaches that I ended up causing our forum users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could have saved a lot of time by performing the upgrade on a local
machine instead of a shared host. &amp;nbsp;As I said earlier in the post,
part of the upgrade requires rebuilding the posts, which means that
all 200,000+ posts have to be read and processed. &amp;nbsp;My shared host
took several hours to do this, partly because there are CPU limits on
my account and because I'm competing for resources. &amp;nbsp;It probably
would have been smarter to run the upgrade on one of my local
machines and then to upload the results to my host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Janitorial work is important. &amp;nbsp;Some of the headaches that I
encountered during my upgrade process came from obscure database and
directory names. &amp;nbsp;To make matters worse, I didn't clean things out.
&amp;nbsp;If I spend some time playing website janitor for a bit, I'll
probably be able to avoid most of those headaches next time we do a
major upgrade. &amp;nbsp;Since we have a new website in the works, I have an
opportunity to apply this lesson now-ish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thanks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owe a big thanks to the following people, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k776 (Kieran): &amp;nbsp;Thank you so much for staying on IRC with me during
the upgrade! &amp;nbsp;Having someone to talk to during the process made the
whole thing go quicker. &amp;nbsp;Having a second set of eyes and someone who
could assist me was a huge help and motivator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ykkrosh (Phillip): &amp;nbsp;You solved the most crucial bug in the upgrade.
&amp;nbsp;You rock!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeru (Aviv): &amp;nbsp;Thanks for helping out with testing and steering the
process. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for being so dedicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wijitmaker (Jason): &amp;nbsp;Every time I needed something from IPB, you were
there to supply it. &amp;nbsp;I never had to wait for support from you -- you
were &amp;quot;just there&amp;quot; with a reply in an instant. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for being so
responsive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feneur (Erik): &amp;nbsp;You've always been there when I needed input and to
provide encouragement and praise. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for making me feel like
part of the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of the WFG team and our users: &amp;nbsp;Thank you all so much for
your patience, persistence, and feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto beta 4 and our new website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

used some SQL to help identify breaks in the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openstreetmap.org"&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;'s road map. &amp;nbsp;If you recall,
I created a table that contained a list of points and descriptions for
each of those points. &amp;nbsp;In this post, I'll use this table to create a WMS
layer that will be overlaid onto an OSM map. &amp;nbsp;The description field will
be used to style the points so that I can easily tell what we need to do
to repair them (eg, add nodes, move nodes, investigate further, etc).
&amp;nbsp;Then, I'll choose a tool to actually perform the repair and allow the
rest of the community to benefit from these findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="tools"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defacto tool for this job is the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://josm.openstreetmap.de/"&gt;Java OSM
Editor&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I checked out a few other
tools, but this seemed to be &amp;quot;the one.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;It also supports viewing custom
WMS layers, which will be really useful in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="method"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="orienting-thy-self"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Orienting Thy Self&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First thing's first: &amp;nbsp;I needed to orient myself on the map. &amp;nbsp;By
clicking&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Imagry&lt;/em&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/em&gt;, I added an OSM layer. &amp;nbsp;From
there, I zoomed into my target area. &amp;nbsp;In addition to this, I added
satellite imagery. &amp;nbsp;In this particular case, I'm using some imagery
provided by the MN DOT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make things easier on myself, I took the table that I made
earlier (which I'll call, &lt;strong&gt;DanglingRoads&lt;/strong&gt;) and made it into a WMS
layer. &amp;nbsp;This way, I can easily spot the places on the map that I need to
edit. &amp;nbsp;To make editing even easier, I've styled my new layer by the
error messages that were logged while I was reviewing the possible
errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="cool-layer-bro"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cool Layer, Bro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is pretty simple. &amp;nbsp;First, we can use our favorite WMS server
to create a layer. &amp;nbsp;In my case, I use GeoServer. &amp;nbsp;When adding the layer,
make sure to make all columns of the &lt;strong&gt;DanglingRoads&lt;/strong&gt; table available.
&amp;nbsp;We'll need them in order to style the layer. &amp;nbsp;Next, I applied a style.
&amp;nbsp;I'm not going to post mine but I'm willing to supply it to those who
ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="editing-the-roads"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editing the Roads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to edit the roads, I needed to combine an OSM layer with the
layer made from the &lt;strong&gt;DanglingRoads&lt;/strong&gt; table. &amp;nbsp;In order to add the new
WMS layer, I had to go to &lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;-&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Preferences&lt;/em&gt; and then click on the
&lt;em&gt;Imagery Preferences&lt;/em&gt; button. &amp;nbsp;From there, a custom layer can be added.
&amp;nbsp;In my case, I needed for the layer to have transparency. &amp;nbsp;Because JOSME
doesn't have an option for enabling transparency, I had to append this
to the WMS query string (thanks to Phil Gold form the OSM Newbies
mailing list):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
format=image/png&amp;amp;transparent=true
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, I zoomed in on every point that I had to edit. &amp;nbsp;After
zooming in, sometimes it's necessary to right-click on the layer's name
and select &lt;em&gt;Change resolution&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Once you've zoomed in close enough, you
can click on the &lt;em&gt;Download map data...&lt;/em&gt; button. &amp;nbsp;This will reach out to
the OSM servers and grab a piece of mapping data. &amp;nbsp;From there, you can
edit it to your heart's content and then upload your changes (OSM
registration required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should mention that the tool took some practice. &amp;nbsp;I had to download a
few different pieces of data, attempt to edit them, and then throw them
away. &amp;nbsp;I also had to make sure that I consulted the OSM documentation to
make sure that I was retagging data correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="afterthoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Afterthoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JOSM is a powerful tool, but it has its quarks. &amp;nbsp;First and foremost, it
has a built in (editable) memory limit. &amp;nbsp;The first time that I used it,
I experienced a crash due to the memory limit. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, having to
readjust the resolution of a layer each and every time I zoom in and out
was a pain. &amp;nbsp;I think that editing would have gone much smoother if JOSME
just did this for me. &amp;nbsp;My last and final gripe is that OSM doesn't
support secure password authentication. &amp;nbsp;I feel that any site should
give me the option of not sending my passwords over plain HTTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I've had a great experience so far. &amp;nbsp;The editing has been slow,
but it's been smooth and easy. &amp;nbsp;I still have more edits to commit, so
I'm sure I'll discover new tricks along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to all the folks at OSM for creating such an awesome product and
set of tools!&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;nbsp;Though OSM has been great to me, it hasn't come without its flaws. &amp;nbsp;In
my work, I rely on roads being physically connected. &amp;nbsp;That is, if two
roads don't touch, then I assume that you cannot simply travel from one
to the other. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, OSM data has several breaks in it. &amp;nbsp;This
became horribly apparent when I released my first demo (I won't link to
it because it's horrible). &amp;nbsp;When a user would click two points, they
would sometimes (a lot of times) get crazy routes. &amp;nbsp;Sometimes short
routes would fail altogether! &amp;nbsp;This is simply unacceptable. &amp;nbsp;I could try
to overcome this in my software, but I'm not that smart. &amp;nbsp;There are
plenty of places that roads come close together without allowing a
driver to hop from one to the other. &amp;nbsp;So, I decided to search for ways
to fix the data. &amp;nbsp;In this case, I'm searching for dead ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="searching-with-sql"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Searching with SQL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have all of my OSM data in a PostgreSQL database, so I thought that it
would be easiest to write a crafty query to find places where there are
&amp;quot;dangling roads&amp;quot; (where a road's start point or end point touches
nothing else). &amp;nbsp;My first shot at the query was overly inclusive. &amp;nbsp;If
there was a single object in the whole dataset that didn't overlap with
a given road's start/end, then it was selected. &amp;nbsp;The result was me
selecting every single road's start/end point. &amp;nbsp;Not what I wanted :p.
&amp;nbsp;Fortunately, the people on the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://postgis.refractions.net/mailman/listinfo/postgis-users"&gt;PostGIS user's
list&lt;/a&gt;
don't get headaches as easily as I do. &amp;nbsp; A little help revealed that my
query was much more effective if I reversed my logic. &amp;nbsp;After being shown
how to reverse my query and then adding my own performance enhancement,
I generated the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
(
SELECT osm_id
FROM myosmdata t1
WHERE osm_id NOT IN (
-- list all ids where the startpoint intersects something.
SELECT t1.osm_id
FROM&amp;nbsp;myosmdata&amp;nbsp;t1, myosmdata t2
WHERE t1.osm_id &amp;lt;&amp;gt; t2.osm_id
AND t2.way &amp;amp;&amp;amp; t1.way
AND ST_Intersects(ST_StartPoint(t1.way), t2.way)
)
UNION
(
SELECT osm_id
FROM&amp;nbsp;myosmdata&amp;nbsp;t1
WHERE osm_id NOT IN (
-- list all ids where the endpoint intersects something.
SELECT t1.osm_id
FROM myosmdata t1, myosmdata t2
WHERE t1.osm_id &amp;lt;&amp;gt; t2.osm_id
AND t2.way &amp;amp;&amp;amp; t1.way
AND ST_Intersects(ST_EndPoint(t1.way), t2.way)
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome! &amp;nbsp;Within a few seconds, I had the ID of all the terminal points
on my highway (yeah, I'm only looking at highways, not the whole map).
&amp;nbsp;Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="visualizing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Visualizing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These IDs, in and of themselves, don't do much for me. &amp;nbsp;They tell me
what roads to look at, but I need more than that. &amp;nbsp;If I want to verify
them and eventually fix them, I need to see them. &amp;nbsp;So, I modified my
query a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

)
UNION
(
SELECT osm_id, ST_EndPoint(way)

AND ST_Intersects(ST_EndPoint(t1.way), t2.way)
)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives me the ID of the road and creates a geometry that represents
the exact point that I need to observe. &amp;nbsp;So, I created a table with 3
columns: &amp;nbsp;an id (integer), the geometry (geometry), and a message
(text). &amp;nbsp;I used the above query to populate my table. &amp;nbsp;Cool...now I have
some geometries to look at...time to fire up QGIS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I fired up QGIS, I added a few layers. &amp;nbsp;In order from bottom to
top: &amp;nbsp;all of the roads, my highways table, and the table that we just
created (lets call it, the &amp;quot;points of interest&amp;quot; table). &amp;nbsp;In QGIS, I get
something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.brianstempin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="QGIS screenshot" src="http://www.brianstempin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/1-300x168.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The light green roads are the entire road dataset, the black roads are
the ones that I've defined as highways, and the blue-green dots are the
points of interested. &amp;nbsp;Sweet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="sifting-through-the-display"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sifting Through the Display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the display is cool, it's meant to be functional. &amp;nbsp;Here's the
plan: &amp;nbsp;we can zoom into a group of points of interest. &amp;nbsp;If they look
like legitimate dead ends, we'll simply remove them from the table. &amp;nbsp;If
they're actually problems, we'll note them. &amp;nbsp;Simple enough, but how will
we do this? &amp;nbsp;QGIS is awesome because it also allows us to edit the
datasets. &amp;nbsp;Simply click on the &amp;quot;points of interest&amp;quot; layer (named
something else in my picture), and then go to Layer-&amp;gt; Toggle Editing.
&amp;nbsp;Now, we can simply remove points that don't belong. &amp;nbsp;If we find a point
that we confirmed is bad, we can click on the information button, select
that point, right click in the information dialog, and select &amp;quot;edit
feature form.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;This allows us to edit the feature's metadata. &amp;nbsp;In this
case, the metadata are the other columns in the table. &amp;nbsp;We're interested
in the &amp;quot;message&amp;quot; field. &amp;nbsp;For the sake of simplicity, I tried to keep it
simple and always wrote, &amp;quot;confirmed bad&amp;quot; when I found a bad node. &amp;nbsp;Cool,
yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="improving-the-visualization-and-workflow"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Improving the Visualization and Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to all of the zooming in and out, I sometimes found myself
reexamining the same point two or three times by accident. &amp;nbsp;In order to
avoid this, I modified my display. &amp;nbsp;You can right click on your &amp;quot;points
of interest&amp;quot; layer and click &amp;quot;properties&amp;quot; to get to the styling
attributes. &amp;nbsp;Under, &amp;quot;legend type,&amp;quot; select, &amp;quot;unique value,&amp;quot; and then
under, &amp;quot;classification field,&amp;quot; select the name of the messages column.
&amp;nbsp;Then, click &amp;quot;classify.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;If you were cool like me and were consistent
with your message, you should only have two or three classifications.
&amp;nbsp;After some work, my map looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="http://www.brianstempin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="QIS screenshot" src="http://www.brianstempin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/2-300x168.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know which points that I've evaluated and which ones that I've already
confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-notes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I've finished identifying my dangling roads, I'll go to OSM and
submit the fixes. &amp;nbsp;Since I've never done that before, I don't want to
cover it here. &amp;nbsp;I'd rather save the embarrassment of stumbling through
the process for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you're editing, you might notice that the database isn't being
updated. &amp;nbsp;Your changes won't be submitted until you either click the
&amp;quot;Toggle Editing&amp;quot; button again or until you close QGIS. &amp;nbsp;At that point
you'll be prompted. &amp;nbsp;If you choose to save,the edits will be committed
to the database and will be visible to other queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email thread where I begged for help (and in poor English I might
add...I should sleep more often) can be found
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2010-November/thread.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;The subject is, &amp;quot;Query to select dangling line segments.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

minivans and Ford Foci collide in August of this year. &amp;nbsp;My car got
nailed (read: totaled), so I got thrown into the market for a new car.
&amp;nbsp;The Focus had always served me well (I've owned two of them), so I
naturally went back to Ford for a third. &amp;nbsp;I had the same constraints
that were in place when I purchased my first two cars: &amp;nbsp;it had to be
reasonably cheap (&amp;lt;$20k), get good gas mileage (&amp;gt;30 MPG), and have a
stick shift. &amp;nbsp;Generally, the last requirement is a pain...Ford seems to
think that I only want a stick shift if I want a car with the
bare-minimum in accessories, or that I want one that has all of them.
&amp;nbsp;It's a bit of a pain to find a Focus that is decently equipped and has
a stick. &amp;nbsp;Remembering my pain, I was open to looking at other vehicles.
&amp;nbsp;As you'd expect, the dealership that I initially went to took that and
ran with it by introducing me to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Fiesta"&gt;Ford
Fiesta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn't purchase a car from that dealership, but I did end up
purchasing a&amp;nbsp;metallic&amp;nbsp;lime sedan model from C and C Ford in Horsham
(never again, btw -- would not recommend). &amp;nbsp;Here's my experience so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="appearance"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appearance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car looks pretty awesome! &amp;nbsp;Some positive bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The color is awesome&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sitting in the front makes you feel like you're in a cockpit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The red glow of the buttons in the dark looks pretty slick&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The body has a pretty unique shape. &amp;nbsp;One friend described it as a
'bullet'&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;None. &amp;nbsp;I have yet to find anything about the car that is
aesthetically unpleasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ride/Feel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, I'm pretty satisfied here. &amp;nbsp;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The clutch has a much tighter feeling than my 2007 Ford Focus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stick has a nice &amp;quot;click&amp;quot; into each speed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The engine has a nice hum&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The seat hugs me nicely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I only have 120-ish HP. &amp;nbsp;Hills and acceleration (when above 40 MPH)
sucks. &amp;nbsp;My friend had trouble merging my car into highway traffic
because he wasn't anticipating the lack of power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reverse is a pain. &amp;nbsp;For some reason, it's always a pain to get into
reverse without grinding or having the false feeling of being
in-gear. &amp;nbsp;It's fairly annoying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="entertainment-sytem"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Entertainment Sytem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first vehicle with &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Sync"&gt;MS
Sync&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;At first I was pretty
impressed, but that kind of faded away. &amp;nbsp;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Built-in USB port (VERY NICE!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth audio streaming (VERY NICE!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bluetooth phone tethering (for voice and data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The mic for the driver is mounted above their head and sounds very
nice. &amp;nbsp;No one knew that I was driving when I was talking to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On-dash keypad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Steering wheel mounted media controller (change inputs and switch
tracks where applicable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decent sound system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice control (pretty impressive)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My car decided that it no longer wanted to pair with my phone. &amp;nbsp;Car
forums suggest that a hard reset or that disconnecting the batter is
the best fix. &amp;nbsp;Eww, Ford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sound system lacks on the lower end at any volume above 12 or 13
(the stereo goes up to 30)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The volume dial lies (see the next paragraph)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Switching songs is slow when using a USB/Bluetooth device as input&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I hit the &amp;quot;voice command&amp;quot; button, there's a 1 in 20 chance that
the music will stop, but the unit will not prompt me for input and
will not accept voice commands until I power cycle the unit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, I thought that I should take some time to elaborate on
the pros and cons here. &amp;nbsp;I was pretty blown away by Sync at first. &amp;nbsp;Once
it indexed my iPod Touch, it worked really well. &amp;nbsp;It blew me away! &amp;nbsp;Then
I started noticing flaws. &amp;nbsp;For whatever reason, switching tracks was
taking forever. &amp;nbsp;My in-dash CD player was switching tracks 2-4 times
faster than the MP3 player (note: &amp;nbsp;this might be an iPod interface
problem). &amp;nbsp;Then, my phone stopped pairing with my car. &amp;nbsp;My roommate's
phone was also paired, and we were able to confirm that it wasn't just
my phone...it didn't like anybody's phone! &amp;nbsp;Lastly, I cited complaints
about the sound. &amp;nbsp;I have the 'upgraded' sound system. &amp;nbsp;It's ok, but I
can't imagine what the stock system must be like! &amp;nbsp;The low end fades
away pretty quickly, which stinks. &amp;nbsp;Also, the car's volume doesn't
actually go to 30 as I noted in the bullet list. &amp;nbsp;It stops getting
louder after 18. &amp;nbsp;I'm pretty sure that the sound quality in my Focus was
on-par with the Fiesta *and* was louder. &amp;nbsp;So much for an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="other-thoughts"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Other Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've really come to love my car. &amp;nbsp;The vehicle is an awesome piece of
machinery -- I definitely made the right purchase. &amp;nbsp;However, I have a
few negative things to express as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, I experienced a pretty scary moment while driving
one day. &amp;nbsp;While driving through Temple University's campus, I attempted
to hit my&amp;nbsp;accelerator while leaving a stop sign. &amp;nbsp;I was surprised by an
obstruction. &amp;nbsp;I managed to limp the car to the curb and to reach down to
find out what was stuck on my pedal. &amp;nbsp;It turned out to be a piece of air
duct. &amp;nbsp;This could have been really scary if it had fallen under my break
pedal (I'm sure you can imagine). &amp;nbsp;I haven't had time to do so, but when
I finally get it repaired, I intend on reporting this to Ford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I was delivered a car that had window switches that didn't work.
&amp;nbsp;From the driver's panel, I'm able to put down my back driver's side
window, but unable to put it back up. &amp;nbsp;I have to reach back to that door
and use its switch to put it up. &amp;nbsp;It's a minor inconvenience, but I
think it was easily preventable. &amp;nbsp;The dealership spent time detailing
the car before delivering it to me, so why not test some of the basic
functions? &amp;nbsp;I'm sure I'll complain more once I have to actually take the
time to get it fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think it's a great car. &amp;nbsp;If I had to do it all over again,
I'd buy the same car (though from someone else -- I blame the dealership
for some of my issues).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&amp;nbsp;After the initial setup, I wasn't quite sure what to do with it. &amp;nbsp;After
some thought, it hit me: &amp;nbsp;I'll move my GIS project to the cloud!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a few motivations for doing this. &amp;nbsp;The first and foremost
motivation was the newfound ability to show off my project. &amp;nbsp;My current
GIS server sits on a hidden network at Temple University, so people
can't just access my demos. &amp;nbsp;My second motivation was reliability. &amp;nbsp;My
current GIS machine is an old &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_OptiPlex"&gt;Dell
Optiplex&lt;/a&gt; GX270 running a
Pentium 4. &amp;nbsp;It had already died on my twice, and I didn't feel like
waiting for it to die a third time. &amp;nbsp;My last motivation was performance.
&amp;nbsp;Linode will give your VM full reign over the box's processor if no one
else is using it. &amp;nbsp;If other people are using it, then it splits the CPU
time evenly. &amp;nbsp;From what I've seen, my Linode's box is fairly unused, so
I get to use quite a bit more horsepower than my P4 affords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the transition has been pretty smooth. &amp;nbsp;I haven't posted any
demos yet, but I have moved my GIS data, moved my code from SVN to
Mercurial (hosted on my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org"&gt;bitbucket&lt;/a&gt; account),
and even upgraded some of the software in the process. &amp;nbsp;I'm now running
a newer version of Postgres and Geoserver, which should give me some
capabilities that I didn't have before. &amp;nbsp;I've even discovered some new
faults in my map!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I can start posting links, etc, I have to do some serious
cleanup. &amp;nbsp;First and foremost, I have to find the dataset that I used for
the CIST demo that I published a while back. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, I have to
produce a demo that doesn't stink :). &amp;nbsp;My first demo wasn't terrible,
but there were quite a few graph errors. &amp;nbsp;This involves me taking some
time to do a very special task that I wasn't given time to do when I was
under Prof. Slobodan's leadership: &amp;nbsp;documentation. &amp;nbsp;I need to go though
and document some of my processes. &amp;nbsp;I also need to modify my tools to
automatically create unique names for my result sets and to put my logs
in one central place. &amp;nbsp;I have some work ahead of me before I can do any
sort of meaningful development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's to a new start!&lt;/p&gt;

recently received an email that furnished me with my account credentials
and details. &amp;nbsp;I couldn't wait to play around, so I immediately dropped
what I was doing and hopped right in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I'm pretty impressed. &amp;nbsp;I decided to allocate all of my disk and
RAM resources to a single VM instance, so I currently have a machine in
the cloud running &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ubuntu.com"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; 10.04 LTS with 512MB
of ram and a 16GB disk. &amp;nbsp;The first thing to note is that having a
machine imaged takes almost no time at all. &amp;nbsp;I selected the OS,
allocated the resources, and I had a machine in &amp;lt; 5 minutes. &amp;nbsp;I was then
impressed again with the speed of the machine. &amp;nbsp;Once I was able to SSH
in, I installed some packages (PHP, PostgreSQL, Tomcat, Apache, and a
few others). &amp;nbsp;The instance was very snappy and responsive through the
install process. &amp;nbsp;Last, but not least, the web interface for managing my
Linode account is pretty awesome. &amp;nbsp;The interface is very nicely laid
out, very responsive, and generally awe inspiring (I wish I could make
interfaces that nice). &amp;nbsp;They even provide an AJAX terminal into your
instance should you be locked out for some reason!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm hoping to spend a little more time playing around with my new toy.
&amp;nbsp;I need a place to host
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaServer_Pages"&gt;JSP&lt;/a&gt; applications for
my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bdpaphilly.org/"&gt;BDPA students&lt;/a&gt;, so I might be interested
in keeping this instance once my free trial expires. &amp;nbsp;We'll see how it
handles once I start placing a regular load on it.&lt;/p&gt;

doing some digging, I realized that I didn't have much to show. &amp;nbsp;Most of
the cool stuff that I wrote was proprietary, so I couldn't just expose
it. &amp;nbsp;The stuff that I've written for myself has been very hackish and
incomplete. &amp;nbsp;Some of the stuff was written as a mod to other PHP
scripts, so the code was out-of-context. &amp;nbsp;So, here I sit with my
tactical pants around my ankles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make sure that this sort of thing doesn't happen again, I've
started a public code repo for people to look at. &amp;nbsp;In this code repo, I
solve programming problems from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://projecteuler.net"&gt;Project
Euler&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If you use Mecurial, you can &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/bstempi/projecteuler"&gt;check
out the code directly&lt;/a&gt; or
go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bitbucket.org/bstempi/projecteuler/overview"&gt;my BitBucket
page&lt;/a&gt; and get a
zipped version. &amp;nbsp;Currently, the language of choice, as stated, is PHP.
&amp;nbsp;I might add other languages as time progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the repo is pretty empty. &amp;nbsp;My intention is to write
a small framework that will allow you to write self-contained solutions
for each of the problems presented on Project Euler. &amp;nbsp;From there, the
framework will allow a user to call the problem by CLI or web interface.
&amp;nbsp;The framework will be responsible for gathering and passing along user
input and for loading the appropriate PHP files to solve the problem.
&amp;nbsp;Each solution will be responsible for implementing a small interface,
validating it's own input, and providing all of it's own methods. &amp;nbsp;As
problems accumulate, I'll probably move some of the mathematical and
validation functions from each of the solutions into some sort of shared
static library in order to reduce the amount of work in solving each
additional problem and to reduce my code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit that this is a little nerve racking; I'm not used to others
reviewing my code. &amp;nbsp;As always, feedback is welcome (probably a little
more than usual). &amp;nbsp;Happy hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

Source Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Harrisburg, PA a few weeks
ago (16OCT). &amp;nbsp;We had a pretty awesome time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to HBurg kind of late (around 10ish, I think), but we still
managed to make it in time for lunch and to see a few talks. &amp;nbsp;I think
the most interesting one that I saw was about
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lessfs.com/wordpress/"&gt;lessfs&lt;/a&gt; and ZFS. &amp;nbsp;I'm definitely
tempted to use lessfs for a backup volume or something of the sort.
&amp;nbsp;Most people have head of ZFS, but for those of you who haven't heard of
lessfs: &amp;nbsp;it's a file system that does de-duplication on-the-fly. &amp;nbsp;It can
even do on-the-fly compression if you have the processor to handle that
kind of load. &amp;nbsp;The thing that impressed me the most was the
demonstration. &amp;nbsp;For the demo, the presenter took several Ubuntu ISOs
(such as Ubuntu 10.04, Kubuntu 10.04, Xubuntu 10.04, Mythbuntu 10.04,
etc) and placed them all in the same folder. &amp;nbsp;Because the ISOs all share
several of the same packages, some of the ISOs occupied no space on the
volume. &amp;nbsp;Pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke towards the end of the day (I was on the next-to-last track). &amp;nbsp;I
thought I did kind of 'eh,' but in the words of another presenter, &amp;quot;No
one threw tomatoes at me, so I guess I did ok.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;I touched on several
things, including &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://postgis.refractions.net/"&gt;PostGIS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.qgis.org/"&gt;QuantumGIS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.geoserver.org"&gt;GeoServer&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openlayers.org/"&gt;OpenLayers&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;A few people approached me
after the conference and told me that they attended my talk because of
potential ideas that they had (I wish they said that during my talk when
I was taking questions :p). &amp;nbsp;Some of them seemed pretty cool. &amp;nbsp;I'm
hoping that a few of them reach out and contact me with their
progress...I'm interested in hearing how my talk has helped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, a group of us went over to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.abcbrew.com/index_flash.htm"&gt;Appalachian Brewing
Company&lt;/a&gt; for dinner and a few
drinks. &amp;nbsp;Note to self: &amp;nbsp;never try the sampler pack again! &amp;nbsp;I'm not sure
what it was about their beer, but it hit me funny. &amp;nbsp;It didn't make me
drunk -- just&amp;nbsp;incapacitated. &amp;nbsp;Other than the after effects, ABC and the
gang was pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely plan on doing CPOSC again next year. &amp;nbsp;Maybe by then, I'll
have another talk (perhaps one that doesn't suck? :p). &amp;nbsp;We'll see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS -- &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.cposc.org/cposc2010"&gt;slides were posted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Lefkovitz&lt;/a&gt; asked me to help him
diagnose a problem with a web app.&amp;nbsp; The issue involved the communication
between a browser and an AJAX web service used for authentication.&amp;nbsp; The
initial struggle was trying to find an easy and elegant way of viewing
the AJAX request and response.&amp;nbsp; The answer was simple:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://getfirebug.com/"&gt;Firebug&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue! &amp;nbsp;After seeing
Firebug in action, I was asked to prepare a short lecture and
demonstration of Firebug so that my classmates can benefit from this
tool. &amp;nbsp;My notes and demo follow below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-need"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every rookie web dev shares the same initial thought:&amp;nbsp; web apps are
impossible to debug!&amp;nbsp; There's always several languages involved (some
server side language, HTML, and possibly some CSS, JavaScript and
SQL).&amp;nbsp; Diagnosing problems with compiled code is hard enough...how do
we diagnose problems when those programs present HTML instead of
direct screen output?&amp;nbsp; How do we diagnose problems with the output
itself (like HTML and JavaScript errors)?&amp;nbsp; Where the hell is
System.out.println()?&amp;nbsp; We can't view what's going on inside of the web
browser!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes you can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firebug does exactly that:&amp;nbsp; allow you to view what is going on inside of
the browser.&amp;nbsp; You can see how Firefox is interpreting your HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript.&amp;nbsp; You can also see raw HTTP sessions, response times, and
can step though JavaScript code.&amp;nbsp; Finally, a way to see exactly what the
browser sees! Note: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.chromium.org/devtools"&gt;Chrome has a
tool&lt;/a&gt; similar to Firebug built in.
&amp;nbsp;Internet Explorer also has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_Developer_Toolbar"&gt;similar
plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-firebug"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Firebug&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firefox has a pretty awesome plug-in engine.&amp;nbsp; To get Firebug, simply
go to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.getfirebug.com"&gt;getfirebug.com&lt;/a&gt; and click the
&amp;quot;Install Firebug for Firefox&amp;quot; button in the upper-right hand corner of
the page.&amp;nbsp; Easy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-started"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that you have a new icon in the lower-right hand corner
of the Firefox window after restarting the browser.&amp;nbsp; This button
toggles the Firebug display.&amp;nbsp; By clicking on this button, you can
toggle the Firebug view on and off.&amp;nbsp; When you toggle the window on,
you'll get something that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Firebug window" src="http://getfirebug.com/wiki/images/7/7d/Console_Panel.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll notice that there are 6 tabs along the top: console, HTML, CSS,
script, DOM, and net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="console"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The console is actually a JavaScrip console. &amp;nbsp;It allows you to execute
JavaScript code and observe errors, both in real time. &amp;nbsp;This means that
you can type lines of JavaScript code right into the console and they'll
execute on-the-spot. &amp;nbsp;I personally don't use this feature too much, but
I'm sure others do. &amp;nbsp;It's worth noting here that when you click on the
Console tab for the first time it will be disabled. &amp;nbsp;Several of the tabs
are disabled by default when you start Firebug. &amp;nbsp;This is because of
performance reasons -- there's no sense in starting up every single tab
(some of which can be a burden to the system) if you just want to debug
some HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="html"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HTML&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel allows you to see how your HTML is being interpreted by
FF.&amp;nbsp; It also allows you to see the 'current' HTML.&amp;nbsp; That means that if
you write some JavaScript code that modifies the page, this view will
reflect those changes. &amp;nbsp;You can also modify HTML through this console.
This panel also has a tool that allows you to visually select an
element and then takes you to the appropriate place in the code.
Conversely, if you float your mouse over a bit of HTML code, the
element within the HTML page will be highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="css"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CSS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the HTML panel, this view allows you to see how your CSS
rules are interpreted and applied.&amp;nbsp; You can turn off individual rules,
add rules, or modify rules on-the-fly.&amp;nbsp; You can even see which rules
supersede other rules and which rules are superseded.&amp;nbsp; This is really
useful for testing changes in CSS without having to go through the
write-save-reload-view process.&amp;nbsp; You can change the CSS within the
browser and view the changes without having to constantly switch
windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="script"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section is the most mystical and magical thing that you'll see
today if you have ever had to do any sort of JavaScript debugging
prior to knowing about Firebug.&amp;nbsp; Firebug will allow you all of the
same debugging features for JavaScript that Netbeans would give you
for Java.&amp;nbsp; You can step through lines of code, set up break points,
and view variable values during execution.&amp;nbsp; It'll even show you the
stack, which is useful for trying to figure out which anonymous
functions you're buried in. &amp;nbsp;Syntax and interpretation errors are also
caught easily using this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="dom"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DOM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOM explorer allows you to navigate the DOM and to view each
object's properties.&amp;nbsp; This is helpful when doing JavaScript debugging
and design. &amp;nbsp;Unlike the HTML view, the DOM view will show you the
JavaScript properties for objects or elements that you're interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="net"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Net&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel allows you to see network traffic from a high level.&amp;nbsp; It
will show each HTTP(S) request that the browser makes, the time it
took for the server to respond, the length and time of the response,
it's content, etc etc.&amp;nbsp; This is really useful for trying to track down
latency problems or to view AJAX or web service communications. &amp;nbsp;It
also allows you to benchmark your web sites performance (eg, is the
page loading slow due to a slow server response, or the browser
choking on JavaScript code?). &amp;nbsp;This view provides sub-tabs that allow
you to drill down to view only certain types of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="exercise"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to help show off some of Firebug's features, I decided to
make up an
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianstempin.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/firebugExample.html.zip"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;
to show some of the potential uses. &amp;nbsp;Some of the exercises are in text,
while others will be verbally stated. &amp;nbsp;This file probably won't make too
much sense unless you're in class to see the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ze-end"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ze End&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to leave comments or to ask questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've spent a lot of time doing &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;
work. &amp;nbsp;I've spent some time in the community and a lot of time using,
hacking, and theming WordPress. &amp;nbsp;As I've stated before in other posts,
this site is powered by WordPress. &amp;nbsp;Being so involved with WP, I decided
to pay attention to an important &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/07/22/1935248/WordPress-Creator-GPL-Says-WP-Template-Must-Be-GPLd"&gt;debate that I saw roll across
Slashdot&lt;/a&gt;:
&amp;nbsp;Should all WP themes and plugins be
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"&gt;GLP&lt;/a&gt;'d?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the GPL's
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license"&gt;viral&lt;/a&gt;...I get that.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ma.tt"&gt;The Fearless Leader of Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; argues that themes
can't run without WordPress, therefore they are derivative works.
&amp;nbsp;Others argue otherwise. &amp;nbsp;So the fundamental questions are, &amp;quot;What is a
derivative work?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Is a WordPress theme a derivative work?&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;On the
first question, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html"&gt;GPL
v2&lt;/a&gt; (the license that WP
uses) has this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0.&lt;/strong&gt; This License applies to any program or other work which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The
&amp;quot;Program&amp;quot;, below, refers to any such program or work, and a &amp;quot;work
based on the Program&amp;quot; means either the Program or any derivative
work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation
is included without limitation in the term &amp;quot;modification&amp;quot;.) Each
licensee is addressed as &amp;quot;you&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're theme contains a portion of WP, then it must be GPL'd. &amp;nbsp;So,
what constitutes &amp;quot;a portion?&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;All WP themes contain API calls -- does
this mean that it's a derivative work? &amp;nbsp;Several people argue both ways,
but I'm going to choose a side here: &amp;nbsp;merely using public API calls does
not make your work a derivative. &amp;nbsp;Why not? &amp;nbsp;Well, look at the definition
of &amp;quot;work based on the Program&amp;quot; in the quote above. &amp;nbsp;No modifications are
actually taking place. &amp;nbsp;In the case of a theme, I can look at the first
line in the second paragraph (&amp;quot;Activities other than...&amp;quot;). &amp;nbsp;If your
theme does not contain a copy, is not distributed with, and does not
modify WordPress (in the source code sense), then the license doesn't
apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Here's a few different examples that I came up with:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;Let's pretend that I'm a developer writing a program for Linux. &amp;nbsp;I
want to write a program that does &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; and logs it's actions. &amp;nbsp;When
logging those actions, I use some sort of system call to get the time.
&amp;nbsp;That library that returns the time might be a GPL'd library (GPL, not
LGPL). &amp;nbsp;Does this mean that I'd have to release the source code to my
program because I use a GPL'd system call? &amp;nbsp;Of course not! &amp;nbsp;If this
were true, then it would be really, *really* hard to write closed
source programs that run on Linux. &amp;nbsp;Clearly, this is not the case.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's fun one. &amp;nbsp; Matt Mullenweg made this argument &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-matt-mullenweg/"&gt;during a verbal
exchange&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I think just one way to test it is, you know, take a screenshot of a
website running WordPress without Thesis and then take a screenshot
of a website running Thesis without WordPress.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm not going to get into specifics with Thesis. &amp;nbsp;Let's, for the sake of
argument, substitute &amp;quot;Thesis&amp;quot; with any theme in the world. &amp;nbsp;Here, Matt
is appealing to a common-sense definition of a &amp;quot;derivative work.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;It
makes sense and is a very convincing argument. &amp;nbsp;I, however, reject this
argument because the GPL (poorly) defines &amp;quot;derivative work.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;If I
didn't touch your source, it's not derivative. &amp;nbsp;Sure, my theme might be
designed for WP, but that's not a derivative as per the license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt's argument also appeals to the idea of respecting the Open Source
Community: &amp;nbsp;if I release a theme under a commercial license, am I some
how ripping off the individuals that contributed code to the project?
&amp;nbsp;My answer to this is no. &amp;nbsp;One of the ways that Matt (his company,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://automattic.com/"&gt;Automattic&lt;/a&gt;) makes money is by performing
spam filtering for WP blogs. &amp;nbsp;It's called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://akismet.com/"&gt;Askimet&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;In fact, he mentions this during the
verbal exchange that I linked to earlier in this post. &amp;nbsp;The Askimet
plugin for WP, presumably GPL (I didn't go check), provides access to
Askimet's spam filtering service. &amp;nbsp;Ok, cool -- the plugin is GPL
(presumably), but the service isn't open-source. &amp;nbsp;I can't go grab the
Askimet service's source code and host my own spam filtering. &amp;nbsp;So what?
&amp;nbsp;Well, if I wrote a plugin that preformed the spam filtering WP-Side (on
the host that is actually running WP), Matt would (presumably) argue
that this rips off the community and is a violation of the GPL.
&amp;nbsp;Clearly, he's ok with moving the functionality elsewhere and then
charging for it. &amp;nbsp;Really, he's only GPL'd the interface between WP and
Askimet. &amp;nbsp;Is this really open-source? &amp;nbsp;Is this ripping off the open
source community any more or less than a closed-source plugin that
performs this same function WP-side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think so. &amp;nbsp;What's the difference? &amp;nbsp;In both cases, you're
preventing the user from tweaking the functionality (at least to some
degree) of the service. &amp;nbsp;The Askimet plugin might as well be
closed-source -- most of the magic happens behind curtains that I can't
see through. &amp;nbsp;In the end, the net effect is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, who can get mad at someone adding value to WP though
closed-source means? &amp;nbsp;Sure, it'd be more beneficial to the community if
all plugins, themes, etc were OSS, but closed-source software can still
add value, too. &amp;nbsp;As long as no code is stolen from WP, they shouldn't
care. &amp;nbsp;Closed source is not the devil. &amp;nbsp;Perhaps I don't understand the
WP community enough to really talk too much about the &amp;quot;rip off&amp;quot; factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know -- this doesn't directly effect me at the moment, but this
issue still makes me a bit upset. &amp;nbsp;It's frustrating that some people try
to make the GPL infinitely viral. &amp;nbsp;I love open source software, but I
think that forcing me to open-source any themes that I create is taking
it too far. &amp;nbsp;I work on an open source project (GPL v2), and I can't say
that I'd get upset at someone developing a closed-source add-on and
making money off of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after purchasing it, I installed
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://folding.stanford.edu"&gt;Folding&amp;#64;Home&lt;/a&gt; so that it could
contribute to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.brianstempin.com/projects/temple-acm%e2%80%99s-foldinghome-project/"&gt;ACM's F&amp;#64;H Community
&amp;nbsp;Service&lt;/a&gt;
effort. &amp;nbsp;My friend &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://timjhenry.com"&gt;Tim Henry&lt;/a&gt; thought that the
machine would die from a heat stroke. &amp;nbsp;This model is known for blowing
its power supplies and for leaking capacitors. &amp;nbsp;I thought it would hold
up, so I decided to make a bet out of it. &amp;nbsp;If it lasted a year, then Tim
would have to buy 2 tickets to a heavy metal concert and take me. &amp;nbsp;If
the machine failed within a year, I'd have to purchase the tickets. &amp;nbsp;The
bet was on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I purchased the machine sometime in September, so the machine had to
last until 1SEP2010. &amp;nbsp;I had a scare when the CPU fan died a few days ago
-- &amp;nbsp;I thought this might put me out of the race. &amp;nbsp;After replacing it,
Tim said that this did not constitute losing -- only a dead processor,
dead power supply, or malfunctioning capacitor qualified. &amp;nbsp;This was
great -- I was still in the running!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...until I noticed something. &amp;nbsp;After replacing the CPU fan, I noticed
that the power supply fan was not turning. &amp;nbsp;After getting very hot, the
fan finally loosened up and started turning. &amp;nbsp;This is how I left the
machine this past Saturday. &amp;nbsp;It's now the Wednesday after and my machine
appears to have turned itself off. &amp;nbsp;The power light on the front was
flashing orange. &amp;nbsp;I'm guessing that there was a 'heat event,' so the
machine shut itself down. &amp;nbsp;My power supply's good, but the machine won't
run for multiple days in a row. &amp;nbsp;Go figure that it dies with 5 or 6
weeks of winning the bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that, I must admit defeat. &amp;nbsp;I'll get you Mr. Henry!

so on. &amp;nbsp;I just loved RTSes! &amp;nbsp;I stopped playing them once I got to
college -- I just didn't have time to keep playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I started looking around for a new game to play. &amp;nbsp;I
had a little more free time than I normally do, so I decided to give
some of it to a game. &amp;nbsp;I decided that I wanted to find a Linux game
since I spent most of my time in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ubuntu.com"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;After
looking around, I found a game that showed potential: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/"&gt;0
A.D.&lt;/a&gt; At that time, it hadn't been
released yet. &amp;nbsp;I decided to simply drop my gaming urge and to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="revisiting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revisiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I decided to revisit the 0 A.D. website. &amp;nbsp;They still
haven't released anything yet, but the website stated that they were
close to releasing an alpha. &amp;nbsp;For whatever reason, I decided to comb
through their forums -- I wanted to know more. &amp;nbsp;While lurking through
some of their topics, I came across the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?showforum=306"&gt;&amp;quot;Applications&amp;quot;
thread&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Wildfire Games (the group producing 0 A.D.) had several openings.
The webmaster one caught my eye, so I decided to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=13179"&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a few hours of applying, I head from Aviv Sharon. &amp;nbsp;He quickly
thanked me for my application and invited me to the team's IRC
channel. &amp;nbsp;After speaking with Aviv for a bit, I was welcomed to the
team. &amp;nbsp;I now have access to the group's private resources, credentials
for the website, and a hefty task list. &amp;nbsp;I haven't had a chance to
actually bite anything off yet, but I hope to this week. &amp;nbsp;I'm pretty
excited about working on an open source game!&lt;/p&gt;

the course's website. &amp;nbsp;While thinking the other day, it occurred to me
that I have yet to write about my experience using Moodle, which powers
that website. &amp;nbsp;Since its such an awesome piece of OSS, I figured that it
was worth some space in my blog. &amp;nbsp;Here we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line up front: &amp;nbsp;I like Moodle. &amp;nbsp;I think it can stand to improve,
but I think it's pretty far ahead of Blackboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-to-like"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's to Like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do I start? &amp;nbsp;I spend most of my time teaching courses, so I
guess I'll start talking about what an instructor sees. &amp;nbsp;The first
really cool thing is the topic outline -- you can choose how many
topics/weeks are in your course and prepopulate them. &amp;nbsp;You can hide
and reveal them as you see fit, which makes it easy to recycle
material from course to course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lessons are pretty cool little bits -- within a lesson, you can make
a sort of blog post. &amp;nbsp;You can then attach several objects to that blog
post, such as a quiz, assignment, document, poll, and so on. &amp;nbsp;The tools
to add these items to your lesson are pretty easy and intuitive. &amp;nbsp;You
can even add wikis and forums&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;forums&amp;quot; (Moodle-speak for message boards) are pretty neat, too.
&amp;nbsp;The front page by default is a message board. &amp;nbsp;So, what makes it more
like a message board than a blog post? &amp;nbsp;For one, you can have the post
emailed out to everyone that's subscribed to that forum. &amp;nbsp;By default,
all registered users are enrolled to the front page and each student is
enrolled to the News Forum within each course that they're taking.
&amp;nbsp;There's even an &amp;quot;oops&amp;quot; feature. &amp;nbsp;By default, the forum will wait for 30
minutes before mailing out your post, which gives you a chance to fix
anything that you might have slipped by you until after clicking the
&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot; button. &amp;nbsp;The recipients of this email get a neatly formatted
HTML message that gives them a copy of the post. &amp;nbsp;The user can then
reply directly to the poster via email or on the forum. &amp;nbsp;Unlike (some)
blog posts, these forums support threading -- they can easily carry
multiple questions or discussions per post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiz feature quickly became one of my favorite. &amp;nbsp;Each course has a
pool of questions. &amp;nbsp;These questions could be multiple choice (with
multiple answers or partial credit), true/false, free-response,
matching, calculated (like a math or physics problem), and a few other
types. &amp;nbsp;For the numeric, calculated, multiple choice, and true/false,
the quizzes auto-grade themselves. &amp;nbsp;They can even leave specific
feedback for students based on their answer. &amp;nbsp;You can give them multiple
attempts, each one resulting in a different amount of partial credit.
&amp;nbsp;When giving the quiz, Moodle can even time the student and mix up the
questions for you, helping to cut down on cheating. &amp;nbsp;The free response
question types are pretty cool, too. &amp;nbsp;An instructor gets to leave some
piece of feedback (which is displayed on the student's grade report)
along with the grade. &amp;nbsp;You can delegate grading to another instructor
(such as a TA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assignments are the last of my favorite features. &amp;nbsp;Some of my
assignments require students to write free responses or to create HTML
or Java files. &amp;nbsp;The assignments activity (these objects are all called
activities in Moodle-speak) allows me to easily receive text or files
from a student. &amp;nbsp;I can do things like set hard or soft limits on the due
dates. &amp;nbsp;Once I've received the assignment, I can grade it, leave
feedback, select a grade, and have Moodle notify the student. &amp;nbsp;Slick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-s-to-hate"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What's to Hate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of what I hate lives on the administrative back end. &amp;nbsp;The
biggest of these is the plugin system. &amp;nbsp;CMSs like WordPress and Drupal
allow you to upload packages that it can unzip and install. You can't
do that with Moodle yet -- you have to unzip your own packages and
carefully place each component in the appropriate folder. &amp;nbsp;What a
pain! &amp;nbsp;You need SSH or FTP access to the server to add any
functionality. &amp;nbsp;I hope this changes soon -- this really puts me off.
&amp;nbsp;There are so many good plugins that I'm&amp;nbsp;hesitant&amp;nbsp;to install, such as
Facebook integration, tag cloud generators, and many others. &amp;nbsp;I'd
rather wait for an improvement in the plugin system rather than
attempt an iffy operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default roles that exist work well, but I would like to see some
others. &amp;nbsp;I and many others teach high school kids. &amp;nbsp;It'd be nice if
there were an easy way to link parents and students so that the parent
gets all (or some) of the same notifications that the students gets.
&amp;nbsp;Its a bit of a pain to set things up so that parents can see their
student's grade. &amp;nbsp;I understand that plugins exist to do this type of
thing -- see my first complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Themes -- there's a bit of a sore point. &amp;nbsp;Moodle comes with a few
default themes. &amp;nbsp;Most of them are pretty&amp;nbsp;horrendous. &amp;nbsp;There are a few
that look nice, but they're not very customizable. &amp;nbsp;Drupal and WordPress
(especially with the 3.0 release) allows themes that offer options to
the user, such as certain colors or the ability to set a header image.
&amp;nbsp;No one wants to go hack some code or have to use (S)FTP to upload a new
header image -- yuck! &amp;nbsp;I'd rather just leave my site with the default
looks than to go through that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Moodle's weaknesses, I still think that Moodle is a great
piece of software. &amp;nbsp;Its fairly (some menus get confusing) easy for an
instructor to use and still manages to maintain its power. &amp;nbsp;Its served
me well this year, and I'm sure it'll continue to serve me well. &amp;nbsp;I
like it more than Blackboard and was happy that it came with most of
the functionality that I wanted. &amp;nbsp;The last thing I wanted to do was
try to use WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla with plugins to provide the
additional functionality -- I want it all in one place and
out-of-the-box. &amp;nbsp;Moodle did that for me. &amp;nbsp;Great job, Moodle devs!&lt;/p&gt;

write about two things: &amp;nbsp;Our recent trip to our regional competition at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bowiestate.edu/"&gt;Bowie State University&lt;/a&gt; and our search
for volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;First thing's first: &amp;nbsp;Regionals&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;On Saturday, I took 3 kids from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hscc.bdpaphilly.org"&gt;my
class&lt;/a&gt; down to Bowie State to compete
in the regional HSCC competition (I'd insert a link here, but sadly I
can't find a story that has a permalink...boo!). &amp;nbsp;For those of you who
don't know anything about our competition, here's a rundown:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's 3 sections&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this section, the students are put in a room with a 200
question multiple choice test. &amp;nbsp;They have 15 minutes to get as
many correct answer as possible. &amp;nbsp;The questions range in topic
from general computer knowledge to BDPA history to programming
specifics. &amp;nbsp;Each students completes their own test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this section, each team competes as a unit. &amp;nbsp;They are put
into a room with other students and play a Jeopardy (for lack
of a better analogy) styled game. &amp;nbsp;They must, as a team, answer
one question in each of 5 different categories. &amp;nbsp;There are some
special rules about stealing questions, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the big enchilada. &amp;nbsp;The students will be handed a spec
that details an on-line application. &amp;nbsp;They are free to program
it in whichever platform they please (JSP, ASP.NET, classic
ASP, or PHP). &amp;nbsp;The web application always needs access to a
MySQL database. &amp;nbsp;Along with knowing how to program the front
end, back end, and database, they must also be able to start
and stop their own services. &amp;nbsp;They are given one computer (with
no internet connection), some paper, and 6 or 7 hours to
complete the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we have an all-rookie team. &amp;nbsp;To date, they've only received
training for the Programming section of the competition. &amp;nbsp;Fortunately
for me, these kids are resilient and motivated. &amp;nbsp;Despite their
rookie-like score, they are more dedicated than ever to conquer this
challenge. &amp;nbsp;For those of you who are interested, we'll be competing at
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bdpa.org/conf-2010.php"&gt;BDPA National Conference&lt;/a&gt; at the
end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My call for volunteers:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I was fortunate this year. &amp;nbsp;I had a class full of rookies and a few
dedicated BDPA members (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.facebook.com/bcmayes"&gt;Byron
Mayes&lt;/a&gt; and Norman Williams) who
were there to help students complete their assignments. &amp;nbsp;This year, I
won't be so lucky. &amp;nbsp;I still have great volunteers, but I'll have a
different challenge: &amp;nbsp;multiple classes. &amp;nbsp;I'll have incoming rookies
that will need a rookie instructor and returning kids that need a more
advanced&amp;nbsp;curriculum. &amp;nbsp;As we take on more kids, we also need help doing
administrative duties, such as organizing end-of-the-year events,
sending home report cards, and keeping in touch with parents.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm asking for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like working with high school kids, teaching, and technology,
then you might be able to help out. &amp;nbsp;I've posted a couple of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.idealist.org/if/i/en/av/Org/215974-135/c"&gt;volunteer
listings&lt;/a&gt; on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.idealist.org"&gt;idealist.org&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If you think you might be
interested, follow the first link (the volunteer listings one) and see
if it sounds right for you. &amp;nbsp;If so, follow the instructions for
applying. &amp;nbsp;Even if it doesn't sound like its for you but you still want
to help in some way, please contact me. &amp;nbsp;We can use all of the help we
can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, wish us luck at nationals!&lt;/p&gt;

I was asked to move a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mu.wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress MU&lt;/a&gt;
installation to a new server. &amp;nbsp;I found several articles about moving
around standard WordPress installations, but nothing for the MU
(MultiUser) version. &amp;nbsp;In particular, I had a hard time with changing the
domain name. &amp;nbsp;In this article, I'll assume that you already know the
general procedure (backing up your files and database, moving, and
restoring). &amp;nbsp;All I plan on covering is how to change your installation's
domain name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a text backup of your database. &amp;nbsp;You can do this by using
something like
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/mysqldump.html"&gt;mysqldump&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.phpmyadmin.net/pma/export"&gt;phpMyAdmin&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://downloads.mysql.com/archives.php?p=MySQLGUITools"&gt;MySQL
GUI
Tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using your favorite tool, like notepad,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed"&gt;sed&lt;/a&gt;, or any other text editor
that can handle large files, replace all instances of your old domain
name with your new one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save this file and then import it into your database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the root of your WordPress MU install, there should be a
wp-config.php file. &amp;nbsp;The majority of this file is a series of DEFINE
statements that define some settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;You should see a like like this:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;﻿﻿define('DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE',&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;'olddomain.com');&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
Replace it with:
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;﻿﻿define('DOMAIN_CURRENT_SITE',&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;'newdomain.com');&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
﻿﻿&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For whatever reason, you'll get a register page if you attempt to
visit your site. &amp;nbsp;To fix this, log in as admin and then log out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps somebody. &amp;nbsp;Feel free to comment if you have questions,
concerns, or corrections.&lt;/p&gt;

Services&lt;/a&gt; group. &amp;nbsp;I took over the
maintenance and have only done small things with it -- add new videos,
replace some files, change text here and there, etc. &amp;nbsp;Nothing too
exciting. &amp;nbsp;Back when I first started, the (then) director of General
Education, Terry Halbert, shared her vision of the website with me. &amp;nbsp;She
envisioned a place where students, faculty, and the community could all
interact. &amp;nbsp;She imagined a place to support and eventually become the
Philadelphia Experience (PEX) Passport (the Passport is a booklet of
discount or free admission tickets to several Philadelphia museums,
venues, and historic sites). &amp;nbsp;She wanted a place that would showcase the
wonderful things that were happening in General Education courses and to
promote the Philadelphia Experience. &amp;nbsp;At the time, I suggested moving to
a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system"&gt;CMS&lt;/a&gt; of
some sort, like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.joomla.org/"&gt;Joomla&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day has come. &amp;nbsp;GenEd recently received a grant to redesign their
website. &amp;nbsp;As per the&amp;nbsp;recommendation&amp;nbsp;from a few people from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://community.mis.temple.edu/"&gt;MIS
Department&lt;/a&gt;, which hails from
Temple's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fox.temple.edu/"&gt;Fox School of Business&lt;/a&gt;, we will be
building a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; website over the summer
months. &amp;nbsp;The MIS department's website runs WordPress, so they've given
it a very positive recommendation and offered to help with the
implementation. &amp;nbsp;At the moment, we're still nailing down the specs, but
we're hoping to have this completed in time for the incoming class to
see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can't say much more other than, &amp;quot;I'm excited!&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;This will be a big
feather in my cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;About GenEd:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;At Temple University, we don't have a &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; -- we have GenEd. &amp;nbsp;They
define and develop the classes that students have to take to satisfy
various general education requirements. &amp;nbsp;As a result, this department
in one way or another touches virtually every single student that
comes through our University. &amp;nbsp;In addition to the courses that it
develops, GenEd is also responsible developing the Philadelphia
Experience -- a set of courses and resources to help students take
advantage of and learn from the City of Brotherly Love. &amp;nbsp;They've also
developed the PEX Passport, a collection of free or discounted tickets
that allow students to explore the city for little or no money. &amp;nbsp;This
Passport has also been integrated into some of the classes offered at
Temple and is used to take students outside of the classroom and right
into the environment.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here's a pretty cool thing that I recently saw (did?). &amp;nbsp;Last week, I
traveled down to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.cityofmyrtlebeach.com/"&gt;Myrtle Beach&lt;/a&gt;,
South Carolina with a few friends to celebrate their graduation. &amp;nbsp;We
decided that traveling with 5 people in one car was just too much to
tolerate for a 10 hour drive, so we split into two cars. &amp;nbsp;Now: &amp;nbsp;what to
do for 10 hours? &amp;nbsp;Answer: &amp;nbsp;surf the 'net!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Masterson was driving the lead car, which was co-piloted by
Christian Willman. &amp;nbsp;Here's the equipment being used in the lead car:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rob's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverter_(electrical)"&gt;power
inverter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris's Macbook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTC_Dream"&gt;G1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point"&gt;WAP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short: Chris's G1 has an application called
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.junefabrics.com/index.php"&gt;PdaNet&lt;/a&gt; installed. &amp;nbsp;This
software allows him to connect his G1 to his Macbook (via USB) and to
allow the phone to act as a router and DHCP server. &amp;nbsp;Chris then went on
to connect his WAP to his Macbook (via ethernet) and to bridge the
connection. &amp;nbsp;Now, anyone within range of the WAP could connect and get
internet through his phone...kind of like a MiFi on steroids. &amp;nbsp;In the
chase car, piloted by &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://timjhenry.com"&gt;Tim Henry&lt;/a&gt;, we were able
to get a decent wireless signal while on the highway. &amp;nbsp;For the majority
of the trip (until we got within an hour or two of Myrtle Beach), we
were able to surf the internet from both vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the internet wasn't reachable, we were still able to keep
ourselves pretty occupied. &amp;nbsp;Tim brought a couple of movies on his
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netbook"&gt;netbook&lt;/a&gt;, so we sat it on the
dashboard and routed the audio though his car stereo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess we can find a way to make anything geeky :-P.&lt;/p&gt;

had time to play with either of them. &amp;nbsp;Until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to pick up Symfony first. &amp;nbsp;One of the biggest reasons is that
Netbeans has a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://netbeans.org/kb/docs/php/symfony-screencast.html"&gt;Symfony
plugin&lt;/a&gt; to
help ease development. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, there is an
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.symfony-project.org/jobeet/1_4/Doctrine/en/"&gt;on-line&lt;/a&gt;
(and print) book that walks a new user through developing a full
application. &amp;nbsp;Symfony has some pretty cool things, like the ability to
use different ORMs, an MVC design pattern, and different environments.
&amp;nbsp;The different environments feature is really neat -- if I'm developing
an application, I can enter the development environment by calling my
app through a different URL. &amp;nbsp;This different URL will still call my app,
but it will also enable logging, disable caching, show me all
exceptions, etc, etc. &amp;nbsp;If I want to see how it acts in production, I can
simply call the same app through a different URL. &amp;nbsp;Pretty cool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been a few different apps that I've wanted to write for a
while. &amp;nbsp;I'm not too far into the Symfony documentation, but I'm starting
to think that developing some of these apps would be a good exercise.
&amp;nbsp;I'd talk more about my ideas, but I want to be able to flesh them out
before they get stolen :p.&lt;/p&gt;

(&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.ist.temple.edu/trafficdemo/displayComparison.html"&gt;http://www.ist.temple.edu/trafficdemo/displayComparison.html&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;Some
notes about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The road graph has quarks in it (the data is from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openstreetmaps.org"&gt;Open Street
Maps&lt;/a&gt;). &amp;nbsp;Some places have wonky
behavior because of this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some of the sensors do not have predictors, so there exist cases
where the &amp;quot;shortest path&amp;quot; search will work, but the &amp;quot;shortest time&amp;quot;
search will not. &amp;nbsp;This is a know problem has has a simple&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I attempted to do some caching in order to speed up the application.
&amp;nbsp;If you click 2 points and I use the road graph to preform Dijkstra's
algorithm to find a path, you might have to wait for &amp;gt; 30 seconds.
&amp;nbsp;Instead, I pre-cached the shortest path between each station and
then do a search on the station graph, which is much smaller and
faster, instead. &amp;nbsp;Because we created some manual links and deleted
some legitimate ones, this &amp;quot;layer&amp;quot; of the software can cause its own
quarks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The initial load of the sensor map layer is slow. &amp;nbsp;This can be sped
up by sending less data to the client (currently, sensors and their
metadata is sent, totaling about 1.8 Mb for the whole map). &amp;nbsp;Ideally,
it'd be nice to avoid loading this layer altogether. &amp;nbsp;My initial
thought was to allow a user to just click on the map and to try to
make a guess at which road the user was trying to select. &amp;nbsp;This is
still a possibility, but I never got around to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My software only looks at the highway systems. &amp;nbsp;Its not smart enough
to exit a highway and turn around to go the opposite direction. &amp;nbsp;We
(Vladimir and I) planned on inserting these &amp;quot;cross links&amp;quot; (links
between sensors that are possibly reachable via a U-turn), but we
never got around to it. &amp;nbsp;As is stands, you'll get different route
depending on which side of the road you click on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a few UI bugs. &amp;nbsp;If you have 3 sensors selected and you attempt
to unselect them, you will get a route. &amp;nbsp;This is because they get
unselected one by one, and as soon as I see that 2 are selected, I
request a route. &amp;nbsp;There are a few other minor pains like this. &amp;nbsp;I
just need to spiffy-up some of the client side XHTML/JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that despite some of the challenges and hardships that were
endured along the way, this project turned out really nice. &amp;nbsp;Hopefully,
I'll be able to continue working on it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

of Science and Technology, Temple University) hosts the Future of
Computing competition.&amp;nbsp; For graduate students, it's an opportunity to
show off some of their research.&amp;nbsp; For undergrads, it's a chance to show
off some of their projects or some of the cool things that they've
cooked up in their spare time.&amp;nbsp; Everyone brings in a 36&amp;quot; x 54&amp;quot; poster
and has the option of providing a demo.&amp;nbsp; This year had a pretty good
turnout and had some very impressive projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since my research partner is a graduate student and I'm an undergrad, we
were forced to split our project.&amp;nbsp; Vladimir created a poster about his
prediction algorithms and the possible uses they have.&amp;nbsp; Mine was about
the use of GIS systems to create some of the data models that Vladimir
needed and the practical application of his results.&amp;nbsp; In short, I
created a web application that will allow you to click on any two
sensors within our road network and can give you a shortest path route
from point to point.&amp;nbsp; I have yet to finish this, but the end goal is to
use Vladimir's predictions to weight each segment by travel time so that
the user ends up with the shortest path by travel time.&amp;nbsp; In the end,
Vladimir took second place in his division and I tied for third in the
undergrad division with Steve Palumbo.&lt;/p&gt;

behavior.&amp;nbsp; It turns out that I found a possible bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've used OSS software for quite a few years, but I've never really
gotten involved with any of the bug reporting, testing, or development.
Since so much of my research work relies on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opengeo.org/"&gt;OpenGeo&lt;/a&gt; tools, I decided that I'd start
reporting bugs that I find in those packages.&amp;nbsp; It took me a bit to get
logged on and to find the correct place to file my bug report, but I did
it in &amp;lt; 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view my bug report

&lt;p&gt;Well, I have a fairly small graph (&amp;lt; 650 nodes), so trying to get a C or
Java to interact with my preexisting PHP software isn't worth the boost
in performance.&amp;nbsp; The implementation I found can read my graph from my
database, calculate the shortest distance to every node given the first,
and then give me a path to a specific node in &amp;lt; .5 seconds.&amp;nbsp; For what
I'm doing, that's acceptable.&amp;nbsp; Plus, I plan on caching most of this data
since my graph doesn't change very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here's where I found my code:
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.giswiki.net/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#PHP"&gt;http://en.giswiki.net/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#PHP&lt;/a&gt;Also,
here's a link to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm"&gt;Dijkstra's algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS -- if you decide to use that code, I'm pretty sure you can just get
rid of all mentions of $matrixWidth.&amp;nbsp; They don't appear to use it in the
algorithm itself.&lt;/p&gt;
