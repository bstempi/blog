called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition"&gt;FizzBuzz Enterprise

terribly over-complicating this problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="you-know-buzz-words"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You Know, Buzz Words&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were places that I worked that used, loved, and worshipped certain
tools for no good reason. &amp;nbsp;Many of these tools had qualities worth
loving; but that's not why they were loved. &amp;nbsp;They were loved for
being &lt;em&gt;enterprise&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;quot;WTF does that even mean?&amp;quot; some might ask. &amp;nbsp;Dare
not ask this out-loud unless you want a hurricane of buzzwords to come
your way. &amp;nbsp;Most people can't give you much of an answer, myself
included. &amp;nbsp;I will try to define it nonetheless with a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once worked with someone who loved the Spring Framework, specifically
its caching framework, which is a wrapper on EHCache. &amp;nbsp;This person
loved, loved, loved it. &amp;nbsp;They claimed that it made coding much easier
and made the app run faster. &amp;nbsp;It was like fairy dust for Java. &amp;nbsp;After
rooting around their code, I discovered that fairy dust didn't fix
stupidity. This individual's code would periodically query the
database, build maps from the response, and cache them to prevent
further database hits. &amp;nbsp;The problem was that these maps were never
addressed by key -- they were traversed linearly. &amp;nbsp;It was the worst of
two worlds: &amp;nbsp;a slow building structure that was being queried in a slow
way. &amp;nbsp;You see, the keys were just a concatenated string of several of
the values within its respective entry. &amp;nbsp;No part of the application had
enough data to recreate this key. &amp;nbsp;Ever. &amp;nbsp;It was an order of magnitude
faster to query the database for a specific item than it was to try to
search this unsorted heap of shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, it was enterprise, and thus it was unquestionably better. &amp;nbsp;Also,
this seasoned developer didn't know what a hash map was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="mocking-that-mindset"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mocking That Mindset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's what this project is all about. &amp;nbsp;It mocks people who want
enterprise-y things just because its &lt;em&gt;enterprise&lt;/em&gt;. It mocks PHBs who
throw buzzwords around until someone gets hit in the eye. &amp;nbsp;It mocks
people who abstract for no reason. &amp;nbsp;It mocks people who think that
caches, and in turn, hash maps, are &lt;em&gt;fucking&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;magic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="contribute"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Contribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, and so should you! &amp;nbsp;I had my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition/pull/124"&gt;first pull
request&lt;/a&gt;
accepted some time ago. &amp;nbsp;In this particular PR, I conquered the Java
vendor-lock-in that is &lt;strong&gt;System.out.println&lt;/strong&gt;! Battling vendor and
API lock-in is my favorite hobby. &amp;nbsp;There are plenty of other great
tickets, such as getting FBEE to run on a map/reduce framework,
WebSphere, and Java 1.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, its a great way to help you calibrate how much
abstraction is &amp;quot;just right.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;So often, we have people telling us to
abstract more and to be more modular. &amp;nbsp;No one really speaks much to how
one should choose their battles or where to stop. &amp;nbsp;FBEE is a good tool
because it reminds you of what's ridiculous and what &amp;quot;too far&amp;quot; looks
like. &amp;nbsp;Take a read through the code and the tickets, and you'll find
plenty of golden nuggets.&lt;/p&gt;

quite a bit, and then life came along and gave me an upper-cut. &amp;nbsp;So,
I've decided to go back to donating CPU time to scientific projects.
&amp;nbsp;I'm using &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://boinc.berkeley.edu/"&gt;BOINC&lt;/a&gt; since it allows me to
donate to several projects at once and has a pretty awesome Linux

contact you via PM/email, but haven't got any response, so it's hard

&lt;p&gt;If you do have a moment or two we have things we could use your help
with. Both some forum upgrades etc, but more importantly/hopefully
more interesting as well we are finally getting closer to a new web
site. We do have a designer working on the design, and a web
development applicant who might be able to help out with the
technical stuff. But naturally it would feel a lot better if you
would be in charge of the technical side as we know and trust you.&lt;/p&gt;

whether or not your current situation allows you to help out I'll be
grateful for a reply so we know how things are&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;D'awwwwwww.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've gotten pretty serious about getting a new site
delivered. &amp;nbsp;We've been making a more&amp;nbsp;conscious&amp;nbsp;effort to stay organized,
work hard, and get something tangible accomplished. &amp;nbsp;If you follow the
project's progress at all, you'll see that we've recently closed
a&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://trac.wildfiregames.com/query?group=status&amp;amp;component=Website+%2F+Forum&amp;amp;order=priority"&gt;bunch of website

keep pushing forward!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What Gives?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: &amp;nbsp;I don't think the program is improving. &amp;nbsp;It improved
wonderfully for my first year or two, and then went stagnant. &amp;nbsp;To be a
little more clear, the circumstances have improved (volunteers, outside
involvement, etc), but the program (the impact we have on the kids, how
well we treat our students and alum, our ability to organize) has not.
&amp;nbsp;I believe that our&amp;nbsp;curriculum&amp;nbsp;changes are going to wound the program
and undo the last few years of work that we've (myself, the other
volunteers, officers, and others who've contributed) put in. &amp;nbsp;Quite
frankly, I think the curriculum is nothing short of embarrassing.
&amp;nbsp;Giving up almost every Saturday for 6 months at a time without any
call-outs or mishaps is not easy or comfortable. &amp;nbsp;It's a
welcome&amp;nbsp;sacrifice&amp;nbsp;when it's making an impact and when things are getting
better. &amp;nbsp;I no longer think that's the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="so-stop-being-a-wuss-and-change-the-curriculum"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, Stop Being a Wuss and Change the Curriculum!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;No!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I'm supposed to be part of a team. &amp;nbsp;That means that I'm supposed to
trust others and that others are supposed to trust me so that we can
achieve maximum cooperation. &amp;nbsp;I can't give up every Saturday, be one
of the central hubs of communication, and undo everyone's mistakes. &amp;nbsp;I
have to trust that my team mates, my partners in crime, will fill in
and do what they're supposed to do. &amp;nbsp;After seeing what has gone into
that curriculum, which was written by a Java programmer and adjusted
by a professor with a masters degree in education, I've lost that
trust. &amp;nbsp;It was that awful.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-was-so-awful-about-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What Was So Awful About It?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without actually showing the document, which I think would be unethical,
it lays out a plan for teaching Java, HTML, CSS, JSP, SQL, cyber
security, mobile apps, and their respective tools (Eclipse, MySql admin
tools, etc etc words words words) in less than one calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let that settle in for a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While looking at the 2011 HSCC programming problem, I thought to myself:
&amp;quot;Self, this problem is probably difficult for a lot of the kids that I
went to Temple with.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;The problem's not hard because it's a difficult
problem. &amp;nbsp;It just uses a ton of different technologies that the kids
have to be competent in and have to be able to orchestrate together. &amp;nbsp;In
order for students to troubleshoot their own compilation and run-time
issues, they need to have a good handle on all of those different
layers. &amp;nbsp;They have to understand the non-obvious things. &amp;nbsp;That simply
takes time. &amp;nbsp;To get to the point where someone could do this type of
project at Temple, one had to take 8+ computer science related classes.
&amp;nbsp;That means that if you were a college student, you'd have to pack (and
possibly overload) 2 full semesters of nothing but computer stuff to get
there. &amp;nbsp;Even if someone did this, you can probably guess why they'd have
a hard time. &amp;nbsp;Some of those classes happen in sequence for a reason --
you need to gain understanding in one so that it can be applied to
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;everything in one year&amp;quot; approach is simply unreasonable and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="why-the-public-announcement"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why the Public Announcement?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, this is a big deal to me. &amp;nbsp;I've poured a lot of
heart into this program. &amp;nbsp;This is not being taken lightly at all. &amp;nbsp;If
I'm going to go through the trouble of separation, then I need to have
it clearly stated why. &amp;nbsp;Secondly, I want kids who participated to know.
&amp;nbsp;It's a tough choice for me -- I almost feel like I'm abandoning them.
&amp;nbsp;I want them to know that I refuse to waste their time on something that
I think is not going to benefit them. &amp;nbsp;I want to have an impact on them.
&amp;nbsp;Thirdly, I hope that other chapters and members see this and get
something from it. &amp;nbsp;Even if people disagree with my actions and my
reasons, I hope that I've caused people to take a look at their values
and goals related to this program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, I wish everyone involved the best and hope that they all
prove me wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down tonight and played the AI (experimental) in a game. &amp;nbsp;I
haven't had that much fun in quite some time. &amp;nbsp;Despite being a simple
AI, it gave me a run for my money at first. &amp;nbsp;It definitely did a better
job at building with the initial resources. &amp;nbsp;It was also the first to
have an army and to attack. &amp;nbsp;I thought I was done for! &amp;nbsp;Fortunately for
me, it was pretty good at ignoring anything other than my town hall. &amp;nbsp;If
the AI sent soldiers to attack me, I could attack them while they were
in transit without fear of retaliation. &amp;nbsp;The didn't begin to attack
until they reached their objective: &amp;nbsp;my town hall. &amp;nbsp;Once I realized
that, I came pack for the pwn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Awesome Landscapes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm pretty blown away by the graphics. &amp;nbsp;If you want to get a good look
at the units and buildings, you can mouse-wheel forward to zoom in. &amp;nbsp;The
units look great, the landscape is awesome, and the water effects are
really top-notch. &amp;nbsp;I've noticed a few graphics glitches here and there,
so it could definitely use some more polishing, but over all I'm really
impressed. &amp;nbsp;For some reason, the landscapes were the biggest thing to
catch my eye. &amp;nbsp;They look so much nicer than what I remember seeing in
any of the Age of Empires games (I think &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/ageofmythology/"&gt;Age of
Mythology&lt;/a&gt; was the
last one that I played).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="getting-smoother"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Getting Smoother&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first tried the game back in July, I remember having a hard time
playing. &amp;nbsp;Part of it was my hardware, but I remember having a lot of
glitches and lag once I moved onto a different machine. &amp;nbsp;Since then,
things seemed to have gotten much better. &amp;nbsp;There's still the occasional
glitch or lag here-and-there, but it doesn't really take that much away
from the game play. &amp;nbsp;Don't get me wrong -- I found a few things that I
found a little frustrating. &amp;nbsp;The fun definitely out-weighs the
frustration, though. &amp;nbsp;I was pretty impressed&amp;nbsp;once I started using the
rotate and zoom features while I was micro-managing some of my units.
&amp;nbsp;The zoom/rotate is really smooth and looks really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="get-to-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get to It&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'd highly recommend going and playing 0 A.D. &amp;nbsp;You can &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/page.php?p=14425"&gt;download the
game here&lt;/a&gt; and find
the forums here: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum"&gt;http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;While you're at
it: &amp;nbsp;make sure to enable the anonymous feedback. &amp;nbsp;It helps us know what
kind of graphics hardware our users are running, which helps us to make
the game better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

organize, store, distribute all of my course content. &amp;nbsp;I've fallen in
love with it! &amp;nbsp;It can auto-grade my&amp;nbsp;quizzes, serve as a file repository,
allow the students to keep notes, and track student progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="praises"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Praises&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this year's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hscc.bdpaphilly.org"&gt;BDPA HSCC program&lt;/a&gt; has
started taking off, I started looking at Moodle 2.0 and found some
things that were quite attractive to me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New default theme. &amp;nbsp;I like the new theme more than the old one. &amp;nbsp;The
menus are much easier to navigate and it has a nicer overall
appearance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New wiki plugin. &amp;nbsp;I started using a course to allow all of the
coordinators to communicate. &amp;nbsp;Within this course, I started a forum,
a wiki, and a few file folders. &amp;nbsp;Moodle 2.0's wiki is much nicer than
1.9's and allows for the use of Creole for creating and styling
content, which makes it easier for me to collaborate with my fellow
volunteers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New editor. &amp;nbsp;Moodle 1.9 used a text editor that didn't render in
Chrome without a manual patch. &amp;nbsp;Version 2.0 features the use of
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/"&gt;TinyMCE&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I've not only used
TinyMCE on other sites before, but I've also sites that utilize it.
&amp;nbsp;It's a nice piece that's been well integrated into Moodle. &amp;nbsp;The team
did a really nice job with making sure that TinyMCE can correctly
upload and display images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;plus a bunch more!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="criticisms"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Criticisms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've criticized the Moodle upgrade/update system, and I'll criticize it
again: &amp;nbsp;WordPress has a model to copy. &amp;nbsp;Moodle has taken some steps
forward by allowing for upgrades from the CLI, but it's still not
polished enough to allow me to try and throw away plugins. &amp;nbsp;It's too
much of a process to experiment with new functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bottom-line"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the new version has been running really, really well. &amp;nbsp;The
upgrade was flawless and the site is performing just as well as it did
with 1.9. &amp;nbsp;Another successful upgrade!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

work for WFG lately. &amp;nbsp;Our messaging board system and some other parts of
our website run on the Invision Power Board version 2. &amp;nbsp;We'd happily
keep chugging along, but IBP2 is no longer supported, so we have to move
to IPB3 in order to keep getting updates and new features. &amp;nbsp;Since it's a
fairly large forum (more than 200,000 posts), I thought that I'd take
the opportunity to write about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="process"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process for upgrading wasn't that bad. &amp;nbsp;All I had to do was to
upload some new files, run upgrade.php, and then log into the admin
panel and rebuild the posts. &amp;nbsp;Done! &amp;nbsp;Granted, the process took a while
(rebuilding posts take a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of DB time), but it didn't require that
much effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="benefits"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Benefits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't mean to sound like a sales pitch, but there were some very good
reasons for upgrading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates. &amp;nbsp;IPB2 was no longer maintained, so we weren't getting
security updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spam control. &amp;nbsp;IPB2 didn't have any built-in measures for controlling
spam, but v3 does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ban-hammer. &amp;nbsp;IPB3 makes it much easier to patrol the forums and to
remove offensive posts or to warn users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Editors. &amp;nbsp;The new version has a much nicer post editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="experience"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upgrade was pretty easy...just upload a few files, run a PHP script,
and wa-la! &amp;nbsp;Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version of the package that I was given, 3.1.3, contains an error.
&amp;nbsp;The error was found by one of our developers, Ykkrosh (Phillip):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Assuming this is about the formatting buttons in the post interface,
it looks like it fails when it tries processing the
&amp;quot;ed-0_palette_otherstyles_img center&amp;quot; element, because that name
contains a space and so it breaks the selector passed to
querySelectorAll since they don't escape it properly
('#ed-0_palette_otherstyles_img center input[type=&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;]'). (I
have no idea why they mess around with id selectors instead of just
calling Element.querySelectorAll directly). Given they have lots of
different selector implementations and it might take effort to fix
bugs in all of them, I guess the safer solution is to get rid of the
&amp;quot;img center&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;img left&amp;quot; etc custom BBcodes, since I think we
only use them for aligning images in the site content pages (which
don't use this forum any more).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This error caused all kinds of headaches. &amp;nbsp;The WYSIWYG editor for adding
and editing posts would display HTML tags instead of formatting the text
for you. &amp;nbsp;If you were leaving a reply, it would also clear the text
field if the field lost and then regained focus. &amp;nbsp;What a pain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT -- Everything post-upgrade has been pretty awesome. &amp;nbsp;We now have a
new theme, a &amp;quot;portal,&amp;quot; and a few other nice features. &amp;nbsp;Over all, it's
been a great success!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-moar-you-know"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Moar You Know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did I take away from this? &amp;nbsp;A few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; test enough. &amp;nbsp;I ran through several test upgrades
on my hosting account to make sure that nothing was broken and
identified a few configuration bugs. &amp;nbsp;Some of the other team members
even submitted bug reports, which made me feel good -- I'd rather
find stuff in testing than after deployment. &amp;nbsp;Yet, somehow we all
neglected to actually try to post :p. &amp;nbsp;There were some simple and
crucial tests that I could have run to prevent the few days of
headaches that I ended up causing our forum users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I could have saved a lot of time by performing the upgrade on a local
machine instead of a shared host. &amp;nbsp;As I said earlier in the post,
part of the upgrade requires rebuilding the posts, which means that
all 200,000+ posts have to be read and processed. &amp;nbsp;My shared host
took several hours to do this, partly because there are CPU limits on
my account and because I'm competing for resources. &amp;nbsp;It probably
would have been smarter to run the upgrade on one of my local
machines and then to upload the results to my host.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Janitorial work is important. &amp;nbsp;Some of the headaches that I
encountered during my upgrade process came from obscure database and
directory names. &amp;nbsp;To make matters worse, I didn't clean things out.
&amp;nbsp;If I spend some time playing website janitor for a bit, I'll
probably be able to avoid most of those headaches next time we do a
major upgrade. &amp;nbsp;Since we have a new website in the works, I have an
opportunity to apply this lesson now-ish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="thanks"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owe a big thanks to the following people, in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k776 (Kieran): &amp;nbsp;Thank you so much for staying on IRC with me during
the upgrade! &amp;nbsp;Having someone to talk to during the process made the
whole thing go quicker. &amp;nbsp;Having a second set of eyes and someone who
could assist me was a huge help and motivator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ykkrosh (Phillip): &amp;nbsp;You solved the most crucial bug in the upgrade.
&amp;nbsp;You rock!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeru (Aviv): &amp;nbsp;Thanks for helping out with testing and steering the
process. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for being so dedicated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wijitmaker (Jason): &amp;nbsp;Every time I needed something from IPB, you were
there to supply it. &amp;nbsp;I never had to wait for support from you -- you
were &amp;quot;just there&amp;quot; with a reply in an instant. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for being so
responsive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;feneur (Erik): &amp;nbsp;You've always been there when I needed input and to
provide encouragement and praise. &amp;nbsp;Thanks for making me feel like
part of the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The rest of the WFG team and our users: &amp;nbsp;Thank you all so much for
your patience, persistence, and feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onto beta 4 and our new website!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Source Conference&lt;/a&gt; in Harrisburg, PA a few weeks
ago (16OCT). &amp;nbsp;We had a pretty awesome time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to HBurg kind of late (around 10ish, I think), but we still
managed to make it in time for lunch and to see a few talks. &amp;nbsp;I think
the most interesting one that I saw was about
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.lessfs.com/wordpress/"&gt;lessfs&lt;/a&gt; and ZFS. &amp;nbsp;I'm definitely
tempted to use lessfs for a backup volume or something of the sort.
&amp;nbsp;Most people have head of ZFS, but for those of you who haven't heard of
lessfs: &amp;nbsp;it's a file system that does de-duplication on-the-fly. &amp;nbsp;It can
even do on-the-fly compression if you have the processor to handle that
kind of load. &amp;nbsp;The thing that impressed me the most was the
demonstration. &amp;nbsp;For the demo, the presenter took several Ubuntu ISOs
(such as Ubuntu 10.04, Kubuntu 10.04, Xubuntu 10.04, Mythbuntu 10.04,
etc) and placed them all in the same folder. &amp;nbsp;Because the ISOs all share
several of the same packages, some of the ISOs occupied no space on the
volume. &amp;nbsp;Pretty awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke towards the end of the day (I was on the next-to-last track). &amp;nbsp;I
thought I did kind of 'eh,' but in the words of another presenter, &amp;quot;No
one threw tomatoes at me, so I guess I did ok.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;I touched on several
things, including &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://postgis.refractions.net/"&gt;PostGIS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.qgis.org/"&gt;QuantumGIS&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.geoserver.org"&gt;GeoServer&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://openlayers.org/"&gt;OpenLayers&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;A few people approached me
after the conference and told me that they attended my talk because of
potential ideas that they had (I wish they said that during my talk when
I was taking questions :p). &amp;nbsp;Some of them seemed pretty cool. &amp;nbsp;I'm
hoping that a few of them reach out and contact me with their
progress...I'm interested in hearing how my talk has helped them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, a group of us went over to the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.abcbrew.com/index_flash.htm"&gt;Appalachian Brewing
Company&lt;/a&gt; for dinner and a few
drinks. &amp;nbsp;Note to self: &amp;nbsp;never try the sampler pack again! &amp;nbsp;I'm not sure
what it was about their beer, but it hit me funny. &amp;nbsp;It didn't make me
drunk -- just&amp;nbsp;incapacitated. &amp;nbsp;Other than the after effects, ABC and the
gang was pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely plan on doing CPOSC again next year. &amp;nbsp;Maybe by then, I'll
have another talk (perhaps one that doesn't suck? :p). &amp;nbsp;We'll see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS -- &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.cposc.org/cposc2010"&gt;slides were posted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Annihilation&lt;/a&gt;, and
so on. &amp;nbsp;I just loved RTSes! &amp;nbsp;I stopped playing them once I got to
college -- I just didn't have time to keep playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I started looking around for a new game to play. &amp;nbsp;I
had a little more free time than I normally do, so I decided to give
some of it to a game. &amp;nbsp;I decided that I wanted to find a Linux game
since I spent most of my time in &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://ubuntu.com"&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;After
looking around, I found a game that showed potential: &amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://wildfiregames.com/0ad/"&gt;0
A.D.&lt;/a&gt; At that time, it hadn't been
released yet. &amp;nbsp;I decided to simply drop my gaming urge and to move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="revisiting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Revisiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, I decided to revisit the 0 A.D. website. &amp;nbsp;They still
haven't released anything yet, but the website stated that they were
close to releasing an alpha. &amp;nbsp;For whatever reason, I decided to comb
through their forums -- I wanted to know more. &amp;nbsp;While lurking through
some of their topics, I came across the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?showforum=306"&gt;&amp;quot;Applications&amp;quot;
thread&lt;/a&gt;.
&amp;nbsp;Wildfire Games (the group producing 0 A.D.) had several openings.
The webmaster one caught my eye, so I decided to
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.wildfiregames.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=13179"&gt;apply&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="filling-the-gap"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Filling the Gap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few hours of applying, I head from Aviv Sharon. &amp;nbsp;He quickly
thanked me for my application and invited me to the team's IRC
channel. &amp;nbsp;After speaking with Aviv for a bit, I was welcomed to the
team. &amp;nbsp;I now have access to the group's private resources, credentials
for the website, and a hefty task list. &amp;nbsp;I haven't had a chance to
actually bite anything off yet, but I hope to this week. &amp;nbsp;I'm pretty
excited about working on an open source game!&lt;/p&gt;

school students (I know: &amp;nbsp;who'd trust me with kids?! :p). &amp;nbsp;I wanted to
write about two things: &amp;nbsp;Our recent trip to our regional competition at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.bowiestate.edu/"&gt;Bowie State University&lt;/a&gt; and our search
for volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;First thing's first: &amp;nbsp;Regionals&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;On Saturday, I took 3 kids from &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://hscc.bdpaphilly.org"&gt;my
class&lt;/a&gt; down to Bowie State to compete
in the regional HSCC competition (I'd insert a link here, but sadly I
can't find a story that has a permalink...boo!). &amp;nbsp;For those of you who
don't know anything about our competition, here's a rundown:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There's 3 sections&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For this section, the students are put in a room with a 200
question multiple choice test. &amp;nbsp;They have 15 minutes to get as
many correct answer as possible. &amp;nbsp;The questions range in topic
from general computer knowledge to BDPA history to programming
specifics. &amp;nbsp;Each students completes their own test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oral&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this section, each team competes as a unit. &amp;nbsp;They are put
into a room with other students and play a Jeopardy (for lack
of a better analogy) styled game. &amp;nbsp;They must, as a team, answer
one question in each of 5 different categories. &amp;nbsp;There are some
special rules about stealing questions, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Programming&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the big enchilada. &amp;nbsp;The students will be handed a spec
that details an on-line application. &amp;nbsp;They are free to program
it in whichever platform they please (JSP, ASP.NET, classic
ASP, or PHP). &amp;nbsp;The web application always needs access to a
MySQL database. &amp;nbsp;Along with knowing how to program the front
end, back end, and database, they must also be able to start
and stop their own services. &amp;nbsp;They are given one computer (with
no internet connection), some paper, and 6 or 7 hours to
complete the problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we have an all-rookie team. &amp;nbsp;To date, they've only received
training for the Programming section of the competition. &amp;nbsp;Fortunately
for me, these kids are resilient and motivated. &amp;nbsp;Despite their
rookie-like score, they are more dedicated than ever to conquer this
challenge. &amp;nbsp;For those of you who are interested, we'll be competing at
the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bdpa.org/conf-2010.php"&gt;BDPA National Conference&lt;/a&gt; at the
end of July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;My call for volunteers:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;I was fortunate this year. &amp;nbsp;I had a class full of rookies and a few
dedicated BDPA members (&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.facebook.com/bcmayes"&gt;Byron
Mayes&lt;/a&gt; and Norman Williams) who
were there to help students complete their assignments. &amp;nbsp;This year, I
won't be so lucky. &amp;nbsp;I still have great volunteers, but I'll have a
different challenge: &amp;nbsp;multiple classes. &amp;nbsp;I'll have incoming rookies
that will need a rookie instructor and returning kids that need a more
advanced&amp;nbsp;curriculum. &amp;nbsp;As we take on more kids, we also need help doing
administrative duties, such as organizing end-of-the-year events,
sending home report cards, and keeping in touch with parents.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm asking for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like working with high school kids, teaching, and technology,
then you might be able to help out. &amp;nbsp;I've posted a couple of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.idealist.org/if/i/en/av/Org/215974-135/c"&gt;volunteer
listings&lt;/a&gt; on
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.idealist.org"&gt;idealist.org&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;If you think you might be
interested, follow the first link (the volunteer listings one) and see
if it sounds right for you. &amp;nbsp;If so, follow the instructions for
applying. &amp;nbsp;Even if it doesn't sound like its for you but you still want
to help in some way, please contact me. &amp;nbsp;We can use all of the help we
can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, wish us luck at nationals!&lt;/p&gt;
