                <p>In the summer of 2009, Temple's <a class="reference external" href="http://www.temple.edu/cis">CIS
department</a> handed me a project. &nbsp;They
were plagued by syllabi. &nbsp;Yes, syllabi (the plural of syllabus). &nbsp;Why,
you might ask? &nbsp;Well, at the time of the project (and this writing),
CIS's website was totally static. &nbsp;Every time someone had a new course
or an updated syllabi, it would have to be manually posted by CIS's
webmaster (who also happens to be the co-vice chairman of the
department). &nbsp;Seeing this as a waste of time, my boss asked me to
develop a system that would allow course coordinators to upload their
own syllabi. &nbsp;Since I knew <a class="reference external" href="http://php.net">PHP</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> fairly well, I was told that I was
allowed to develop using a
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a> platform.</p>
<div class="section" id="courses-instructors-and-mapping-the-two">
<h2>Courses, Instructors, and Mapping the Two</h2>
<p>The overall goal of this project was to automate as much of the
syllabus posting process as possible. &nbsp;This started with the maintenance
of courses, instructors, and knowing which instructor taught which
course. &nbsp;At Temple, we use a system called ISIS to manage student,
course, and instructor data (note: &nbsp;I should mention that Temple is
currently moving to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sungardhe.com/Products/Product.aspx?id=832&amp;LangType=1033">Banner</a>).
This system is responsible for a lot of things, one of which was to
(poorly) describe which course was being taught by which instructor.
Having this information on hand, all I needed was information about
each instructor and course. &nbsp;Since instructors don't come and go that
often, someone in the CIS department whipped up a
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> file
containing the instructor's name, email address, office location,
amongst a few other things. &nbsp;Using an import utility that I built, an
admin level user could mass-import all of the instructors. &nbsp;Once
imported, instructors could be added, removed, or modified. &nbsp;Instructors
also have the ability to modify their own data (office, phone number,
etc.). &nbsp;Next came the course information. &nbsp;Fortunately, I was able to
also get course names from the ISIS system. &nbsp;Some of the names were
truncated and thus required a little bit of post-import editing, but
most of the work was done for the user. &nbsp;So, we have a database that has
a bunch of courses, instructors, and a relationship between the two.</p>
<p>Now what?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-syllabi">
<h2>The Syllabi</h2>
<p>The CIS department has standardized syllabus format that their
faculty are to use. &nbsp;Faculty are told that in addition to including the
sections mandated by the university, they must follow a uniform format.
This made representing each syllabus easy -- I just needed to make
several <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varchar">VARCHAR</a> columns to
store the various text. &nbsp;In addition to this, I needed to denote which
course each syllabus belonged to and which faculty member was the course
coordinator. &nbsp;This was important because only the course coordinator was
allowed to officially edit the syllabus. &nbsp;The other instructions were
related to a given syllabus so that their contact information would be
posted at the beginning of the document.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-interface">
<h2>The Interface</h2>
<p>The interface that the student interacts with is nothing too special --
I simply took the Dreamweaver template (yes -- CIS uses Dreamweaver and
Contribute to maintain their site) and added some PHP code to it. &nbsp;The
user can view all of CIS's courses by instructor, course number, or
course name. &nbsp;Unlike the old system (which was just a bunch of HTML
tables that were poorly laid out), this allows a user a few different
avenues of search.</p>
<p>The interface that the administrator or course coordinator used is much
different. &nbsp;I made use of TinyMCE for editing all of the syllabus
fields. &nbsp;I also included some fancy
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)">AJAX</a>. &nbsp;Any time
the administrator wants to link instructors to courses or save changes
to an instructor/course/syllabus, an AJAX call is fired.</p>
<p>Techniques Used</p>
<p>As I already mentioned, I used some AJAX. &nbsp;On the server side, I wrote
a PHP file named ajax.php. &nbsp;This file was responsible for mapping remote
procedure calls
(<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">RPCs</a>) to the
correct PHP functions. &nbsp;In order to reduce latency and to save bandwidth
(not that I was short on either -- this is a small app), ajax.php was
also responsible for encoding success/error messages and for encoding
data between the server and client (this was before I knew about
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>).</p>
<p>Another thing that I had to be careful with was
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation">validation</a>. &nbsp;Since I
was writing an application that was going to be used by computer science
professors, I knew that I needed to program defensively. &nbsp;I attempted to
validate data on the client side via JavaScript for the&nbsp;convenience&nbsp;of
the user, but I also made sure to validate all data on the server side.
Since there was a relatively small number of arguments that the entire
application would receive (&lt; 40), every single piece of data that came
in through a POST or GET was validated based on that argument's name and
datatype. &nbsp;If arguments were sent that were&nbsp;unnecessary, they were
simply ignored. &nbsp;This way, an instructor could enter in raw HTML or SQL
keywords right into their syllabi without me having to worry about one
of them pulling a&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://xkcd.com/327/">Bobby Tables</a>. &nbsp;This also
gave me some piece of mind that the professor who taught the QA course
wouldn't come knocking at my door because of dirty data.</p>
<p>I didn't know what
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> was at
the time, but I unknowingly used an ORM model. &nbsp;Each one of my objects
had a series of fields that were either directly read from a table or
calculated based on table values. &nbsp;Each one of my objects (models)
implemented an interface that I wrote which mandated that they implement
methods that define how to save to and read from a database or
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a>. &nbsp;The related models even had
methods to link and unlink themselves to/from each other. &nbsp;This made it
really easy to load data from the MySQL backend and spit it out to the
client via XML. &nbsp;It was nice to be able to write a small amount of SQL
code within each object and to not have to write anymore SQL code for
the remainder of the project.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP">LDAP</a> authentication was the last
great feature that I implemented. &nbsp;At Temple, we have a system called
AccessNet (now TUSecure). &nbsp;It's the university's LDAP system. &nbsp;It would
be kind of silly to make the instructors memorize yet another set of
credentials, so I worked pretty tirelessly towards the end of the
project to get this bit to work. &nbsp;At Temple, our Computer Services group
tends not to have a very open mind when it comes to certain open source
technologies. &nbsp;I've been told by a few different CS staff that the
department's belief is that PHP itself is a
security&nbsp;vulnerability&nbsp;(would you expect any different from a hard-core
MS shop?). &nbsp;Instead of fighting with them, I went along with it.
&nbsp;Computer Services provides a basic C# class that developers could use
to interact with their LDAP server. &nbsp;In order to get around their
limitations, I wrote a C#.Net <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web
service</a> that would accept
a user's credentials over SSL and return a success or failure. &nbsp;Once
this was done, I wrote some code in my application to use this service.
Things would work in this order:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The user would click &quot;Log in&quot; and get redirected to an HTTPS login
form.</li>
<li>The user would enter their credentials and attempt to authenticate.</li>
<li>My syllabus application would communicate these credentials to my
C#.Net web service via HTTPS.</li>
<li>The C#.Net web service would communicate with the TUSecure LDAP
servers over SSL an receive a response (this response was more
complicated than success/fail).</li>
<li>The C#.Net service would relay a success/fail message to the syllabus
application, which would in turn either grant the user access or deny
the user, respectively.</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, I was pretty proud of this project. &nbsp;There are some
interface tweaks I would like to make, but this app works well. &nbsp;As of
the time of this writing, it's currently in use.</p>
